SMITH\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u20131402. Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nCriminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an im\n  partial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. See\n  Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522. To establish a prima facie viola\n  tion of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove\n  that: (1) a group qualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and rea\n  sonably represented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d in\n  the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.\n  Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.\n     At voir dire in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent\n  Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60\n  and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.\n  At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the County\u2019s\n  jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential ju\n  rors were drawn. The court rejected Smith\u2019s objection to the panel\u2019s\n  racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree\n  murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him\n  to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n     On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court con\n  ducted an evidentiary hearing on Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n  The evidence at the hearing showed, inter alia, that under the juror\n  assignment order in effect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled, the\n  County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and,\n  only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the\n  countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\n  Smith calls this procedure \u201csiphoning.\u201d The month after Smith\u2019s voir\n  dire, however, the County reversed course and adopted a Circuit-\n  Court-first assignment order. It did so based on the belief that the\n  district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit\n\f2                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County. The\n    trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of\n    African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. First, the court de\n    scribed the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d test, under which the percentage of\n    African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the per\n    centage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). According to this measure, African-Americans were under\n    represented by 1.28%. Next, the court set out the \u201ccomparative dis\n    parity\u201d test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by\n    the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population\n    (7.28%). The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, African-\n    Americans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury\n    eligible population, to be on the jury-service list. In the 11 months\n    after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment\n    policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to\n    15.1%. The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans\n    were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires. But Smith\u2019s evi\n    dence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror\n    assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had\n    systematically excluded African-Americans. The court therefore re\n    jected Smith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim.\n       The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new\n    trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\n    order. Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded\n    that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment vio\n    lation. This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no\n    preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinc\n    tive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable. The court noted\n    that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and\n    comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test. Adopting\n    a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of\n    measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had\n    failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measure\n    ment. Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on under\n    representation, the court determined that he had not shown system\n    atic exclusion.\n       Smith then filed a federal habeas petition. The Antiterrorism and\n    Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal ha\n    beas relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision\n    that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n    clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n    of the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a deci\n    sion that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n    light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\n  decision when assessed under AEDPA\u2019s standards, the District Court\n  dismissed Smith\u2019s petition. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Court of\n  Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity\n  test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly ex\n  cluded group is small. The court then held that Smith\u2019s comparative\n  disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans\u2019 represen\n  tation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.\n  It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion. In accord\n  with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit be\n  lieved that the district-court-first assignment order significantly re\n  duced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court\n  venires. Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, be\n  cause no important state interest supported the district-court-first al\n  location system.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme\n Court\u2019s decision \u201cinvolv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly\n established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1). Duren hardly establishes\u2014no\n less \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right\n to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the commu\n nity. Pp. 10\u201316.\n    (a) The Duren defendant readily met all three parts of the Court\u2019s\n prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a\n county\u2019s jury pool. First, he showed that women in the county were\n both \u201cnumerous and distinct from men.\u201d 439 U. S., at 364. Second,\n to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of\n the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those\n summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsum\n mons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn. Id., at 364\u2013366.\n Finally, to show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the underrepresentation,\n he pointed to Missouri\u2019s law permitting any woman to opt out of jury\n service and to the manner in which the county administered that\n law. This Court noted that \u201cappropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemp\n tions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by\n an important state interest, id., at 370, but concluded that no such\n interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, id., at\n 369\u2013370. Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) Neither Duren nor any other decision of this Court specifies the\n method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.\n Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts be\n low\u2014absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard devia\n tion\u2014is imperfect. Absolute disparity and comparative disparity\n measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the dis\n tinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community\u2019s\n\f4                          BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jury-eligible population. And it appears that no court has relied ex\n    clusively on a standard deviation analysis. Even absent AEDPA\u2019s\n    constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the\n    appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.\n    Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith\u2019s statis\n    tical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under\n    either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court neverthe\n    less gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in\n    order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the extent\n    underrepresentation existed, was it due to \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d?\n    See Duren, 439 U. S., at 364. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (c) Smith\u2019s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason\n    to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any\n    significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Cir\n    cuit Court venires. Although the record established that some\n    County officials believed that the assignment order created racial\n    disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief\n    was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence. He introduced no evi\n    dence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit\n    Court\u2019s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Dis\n    trict Court for Grand Rapids, which had the County\u2019s largest African-\n    American population. He did not address whether Grand Rapids had\n    more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent\n    County. And he did not compare the African-American representa\n    tion levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District\n    Court venires for the same region. See Duren, 439 U. S., at 367,\n    n. 25. Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline\n    in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent\n    County reversed its assignment order. But that evidence indicated\n    no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the\n    original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the\n    representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. Pp.\n    13\u201314.\n       (d) In addition to renewing his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument, Smith urges\n    that a laundry list of factors\u2014e.g., the County\u2019s practice of excusing\n    prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and\n    the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\n    appear\u2014combined to reduce systematically the number of African-\n    Americans appearing on jury lists. No \u201cclearly established\u201d prece\n    dent of this Court supports Smith\u2019s claim. Smith urges that one sen\n    tence in Duren, 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369, places the burden of proving\n    causation on the State. But Smith clipped that sentence from its con\n    text: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face\n    case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show to rebut the de\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

The Michigan Supreme Court was there\n  fore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), in concluding that Duren\n  first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrep\n  resentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion. This\n  Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d that jury\n  selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s list can give rise to a\n  fair-cross-section claim. Rather, the Taylor Court \u201crecognized broad\n  discretion in the States\u201d to \u201cprescribe relevant qualifications for their\n  jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.\u201d 419 U. S., at 537\u2013538.\n  And in Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions re\n  sembling those Smith assails might well \u201csurvive a fair-cross-section\n  challenge.\u201d 439 U.

Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975). The ques\ntion presented in this case is whether that right was ac\ncorded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American\nconvicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in\nKent County, Michigan in 1993. At the time of Smith\u2019s\ntrial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent\nCounty\u2019s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from\nwhich potential jurors were drawn.\n   In Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), this Court\ndescribed three showings a criminal defendant must make\nto establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amend\nment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement. He or she must\nshow: \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018dis\ntinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representa\ntion of this group in venires from which juries are selected\nis not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of\nsuch persons in the community; and (3) that this under\n\f2                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group\nin the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 364. The first show\ning is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are\nmore likely to generate controversy.\n   The defendant in Duren readily met all three measures.\nHe complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson\nCounty, Missouri, jury pool. To establish underrepresen\ntation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible\npopulation, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons\nsummoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons\non the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors\nwere drawn. To show the \u201csystematic\u201d cause of the under\nrepresentation, Duren pointed to Missouri\u2019s law exempt\ning women from jury service, and to the manner in which\nJackson County administered the exemption. Concluding\nthat no significant state interest could justify Missouri\u2019s\nexplicitly gender-based exemption, this Court held the\nlaw, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the\nSixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement.\n   We here review the decision of the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith \u201csat\nisf[ied] the prima facie test established by Duren,\u201d and\ngranting him habeas corpus relief, i.e., release from im\nprisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 order. 543 F. 3d 326, 336 (2008).\nDespite marked differences between Smith\u2019s case and\nDuren\u2019s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision\nholding that Smith \u201cha[d] not shown . . . systematic exclu\nsion,\u201d People v. Smith, 463 Mich. 199, 205, 615 N. W. 2d 1,\n3 (2000), the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled. Cog\nnizant of the restrictions Congress placed on federal ha\nbeas review of state-court convictions, the Court of Ap\npeals considered that a decision contrary to its own would\n\u201cinvolv[e] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States,\u201d 28 U.

No decision of this\nCourt \u201cclearly establishe[s]\u201d Smith\u2019s entitlement to fed\neral-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith\nhad demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror\nassignment procedure, which Smith calls \u201csiphoning,\u201d\n\u201csystematic[ally] exclu[ded]\u201d African-Americans. Under\nthis procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors\nfirst to local district courts, and, only after filling local\nneeds, made remaining persons available to the county\nwide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\u2019s.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected\nSmith\u2019s \u201csiphoning\u201d plea for lack of proof that the assign\nment procedure caused underrepresentation. Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. As that determination\nwas not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no\nwarrant to disturb it. See \u00a72254(d)(2).\n   In addition to renewal of his \u201csiphoning\u201d argument,\nSmith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce\nsystematically the number of African-Americans appear\ning on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent\nCounty court\u2019s practice of excusing people without ade\nquate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent\nCounty police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to\nappear. Brief for Respondent 53\u201354. Our decisions do not\naddress factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cau\ntioned, however, that \u201c[t]he fair-cross-section principle\nmust have much leeway in application.\u201d Taylor, 419 U.

SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nThe bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to\n300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were\nAfrican-American. The State charged Smith with the\nmurder in Kent County Circuit Court.\n   Voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial took place in September 1993.\nThe venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals.\nThe parties agree that, at most, three venire members\nwere African-American. Smith unsuccessfully objected to\nthe composition of the venire panel.\n   Smith\u2019s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury.\nThe case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the\nman who shot Rumbley. Thirty-seven witnesses from the\nbar, including Smith, testified at the trial. Of those, two\ntestified that Smith fired the gun. Five testified that the\nshooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identi\nfications of the shooter. The jury convicted Smith of sec\nond-degree murder and possession of a firearm during a\nfelony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment\nwith the possibility of parole.\n                              B\n   On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered\nthe trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on\nSmith\u2019s fair-cross-section claim. The hearing occurred in\nearly 1998. Smith\u2019s evidence showed that Grand Rapids,\nthe largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37%\nof Kent County\u2019s population, and to 85% of its African-\nAmerican residents. Felony charges in Kent County were\ntried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prose\ncuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geo\ngraphical area. To fill the courts\u2019 venires, Kent County\nsent questionnaires to prospective jurors. The Circuit\nCourt Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms\nwere returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20%\nwere not answered. App. 13a.

After filling the district courts\u2019\nneeds, the County assigned the remaining prospective\njurors to the Circuit Court\u2019s panels. Id., at 20a, 22a.\n   The month after voir dire for Smith\u2019s trial, Kent County\nreversed the assignment order. It did so, according to the\nCircuit Court Administrator, based on \u201c[t]he belief . . . that\nthe respective districts essentially swallowed up most of\nthe minority jurors,\u201d leaving the Circuit Court with a jury\npool that \u201cdid not represent the entire county.\u201d Id., at 22a.\nThe Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair\ntestified, held the same view concerning the impact of\nchoosing district court jurors first and not returning un\nused persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selec\ntions. Id., at 64a\u201365a.\n   The trial court considered two means of measuring the\nextent of underrepresentation of African-Americans on\nCircuit Court venires: \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d and \u201ccompara\ntive disparity.\u201d \u201cAbsolute disparity\u201d is determined by\nsubtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the\njury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith\u2019s\ntrial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the\nlocal, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). By an abso\nlute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were\nunderrepresented by 1.28%. \u201cComparative disparity\u201d is\ndetermined by dividing the absolute disparity (here,\n1.28%) by the group\u2019s representation in the jury-eligible\npopulation (here, 7.28%).       The quotient (here, 18%),\nshowed that, in the six months prior to Smith\u2019s trial,\nAfrican-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when\ncompared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on\nthe jury-service list. App. to Pet. for Cert. 215a.\n   Isolating the month Smith\u2019s jury was selected, Smith\u2019s\n\f6                    BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity\nwas 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent\nCounty discontinued the district-court-first assignment\npolicy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped\nfrom 18% to 15.1%. Id., at 102a\u2013103a, 113a.\n  Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in\ndemographics and economics, who tied the underrepresen\ntation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the\nexpert explained, these forces made African-Americans\nless likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility\nquestionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship ex\ncuse. Id., at 79a\u201380a.\n  The hearing convinced the trial court that African-\nAmericans were underrepresented in Circuit Court veni\nres. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith\u2019s evidence was\ninsufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror\nassignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection\nprocess, had systematically excluded African-Americans.\nId., at 210a\u2013212a. The court therefore rejected Smith\u2019s\nfair-cross-section claim.\n                             C\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror\nallocation system in place at the relevant time did result\nin the underrepresentation of African-Americans. Id., at\n182a\u2013183a. Reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, the\nintermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with\njurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment\norder installed shortly after the voir dire in Smith\u2019s case.\nIbid.; see supra, at 5.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment, concluding that Smith \u201cha[d]\nnot established a prima facie violation of the Sixth\nAmendment fair-cross-section requirement.\u201d Smith, 463\nMich., at 207, 615 N. W. 2d, at 4. The Michigan High\nCourt observed, first, that this Court has specified \u201c[no]\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npreferred method for measuring whether representation of\na distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.\u201d\nId., at 203, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2. The court then noted that\nlower federal courts had applied three different methods\nto measure fair and reasonable representation: the abso\nlute and comparative disparity tests, described supra, at 5,\nand \u201cthe standard deviation test.\u201d1\n   Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,\nthe Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case\napproach allowing consideration of all three means of\nmeasuring underrepresentation. Smith, 463 Mich., at\n204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Smith\u2019s statistical evidence, the\ncourt found, \u201cfailed to establish a legally significant dis\nparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity\ntests.\u201d Id., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. (The parties\nhad presented no expert testimony regarding application\nof the standard deviation test. Id., at 204, n. 1, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 3, n. 1; supra, at 5\u20136.)\n   Nevertheless \u201cgrant[ing] [Smith] the benefit of the doubt\non unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,\u201d the\nMichigan Supreme Court ultimately determined that \u201che\nha[d] not shown systematic exclusion.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich.,\nat 203, 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 2, 3. Smith\u2019s evidence, the\ncourt said, did not show \u201chow the alleged siphoning of\nAfrican American jurors to district courts affected the\ncircuit court jury pool.\u201d Id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. In\nparticular, the court observed, \u201c[t]he record does not dis\nclose whether the district court jury pools contained more,\nfewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority\njurors as the circuit court jury pool.\u201d Ibid. The court also\nruled that \u201cthe influence of social and economic factors on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that\n\nthe disparity between a group\u2019s jury-eligible population and the group\u2019s\npercentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance.\nSee People v. Smith, 463 Mich. 199, 219\u2013220, 615 N. W. 2d 1, 9\u201310\n(2000) (Cavanagh, J., concurring).\n\f8                   BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njuror participation does not demonstrate a systematic\nexclusion.\u201d Id., at 206, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n                              D\n   In February 2003, Smith filed a habeas corpus petition\nin the United States District Court for the Western Dis\ntrict of Michigan, reasserting his fair-cross-section claim.\nBecause Smith is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of\na State court,\u201d the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \u00a72254, governed the District\nCourt\u2019s review of his application for federal habeas corpus\nrelief. Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified\nin \u00a72254(d), a state prisoner\u2019s application may not be\ngranted as to \u201cany claim . . . adjudicated . . . in State\ncourt\u201d unless the state court\u2019s adjudication\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nApplying these standards, the District Court dismissed\nSmith\u2019s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a\u201342a.\n  The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the\nallegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled,\ncourts should use the comparative disparity test to meas\nure underrepresentation. 543 F. 3d, at 338. In that\ncourt\u2019s view, Smith\u2019s comparative disparity statistics\nsufficed \u201cto demonstrate that the representation of African\nAmerican veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and\nunreasonable.\u201d Ibid. As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth\nCircuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appel\nlate court, believed that the juror-assignment order in\neffect when Smith\u2019s jury was empaneled significantly\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreduced the number of African-Americans available for\nCircuit Court venires. Id., at 342. Smith was entitled to\nrelief, the court concluded, because no important state\ninterest supported that allocation system. Id., at 345.2\n  The State petitioned for certiorari attacking the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s decision on two principal grounds: First, the\nState charged that the federal appellate court erred in\nadopting the comparative disparity test to determine\nwhether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the\njury pool. Pet. for Cert. ii. Second, the State urged that,\nin any event, \u201cthere was no . . . systematic exclusion of\nAfrican Americans from juries in Kent County, Michigan,\u201d\nid., at 25, and no warrant for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s contrary\ndetermination.3 We granted review, 557 U. S. ____ (2009),\nand now reverse the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n  According to the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment plea \u201cin\nvolved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by [this Court in Duren].\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Sixth Circuit also found that the Michigan Supreme Court had\n\nunreasonably applied Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), when it\ndeclared that social and economic factors could not establish systematic\nexclusion. 543 F. 3d, at 341\u2013342. Because such factors disproportion\nately affect African-Americans, the Sixth Circuit said, Kent County\u2019s\nroutine grants of certain hardship exemptions \u201cproduced systematic\nexclusion within the meaning of Duren.\u201d Ibid. The Sixth Circuit held,\nhowever, that the hardship exemptions could not establish a fair-cross\nsection claim because the State \u201chas a significant interest [in] avoiding\nundue burdens on individuals\u201d by allowing such excuses. Id., at 345.\n  3 Although the question presented by the State homes in on the\n\nproper measure for underrepresentation, it initially and more compre\nhensively inquires whether Smith was denied his right to a jury drawn\nfrom a fair cross section of the community. See Pet. for Cert. ii (asking\n\u201c[w]hether the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in\nconcluding that the Michigan Supreme Court failed to apply \u2018clearly\nestablished\u2019 Supreme Court precedent under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 on the\nissue of the fair cross-section requirement under Duren . . . .\u201d). We\ntherefore address that overarching issue.\n\f10                  BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(d)(1); see 543 F. 3d, at 345. We disagree. As ex\nplained below, our Duren decision hardly establishes\u2014no\nless \u201cclearly\u201d so\u2014that Smith was denied his Sixth\nAmendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair\ncross section of the community.\n                              II\n   To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross\nsection requirement, this Court\u2019s pathmarking decision in\nDuren instructs, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group\nqualifying as \u201cdistinctive\u201d (2) is not fairly and reasonably\nrepresented in jury venires, and (3) \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d\nin the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepre\nsentation. 439 U. S., at 364; see supra, at 1\u20132.\n   The defendant in Duren successfully challenged Jackson\nCounty\u2019s administration of a Missouri exemption permit\nting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U. S., at\n360. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant\nDuren had established a prima facie case. First, women in\nJackson County were both \u201cnumerous and distinct from\nmen.\u201d Id., at 364 (quoting Taylor, 419 U. S., at 531).\nSecond, Duren\u2019s \u201cstatistical presentation\u201d showed gross\nunderrepresentation: Women were over half the jury\neligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for\nless than 15% of jury venires. 439 U. S., at 364\u2013366.\n   Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with\nparticularity. He proved that women\u2019s underrepresenta\ntion was persistent\u2014occurring in every weekly venire for\nalmost a year\u2014and he identified the two stages of the\njury-selection process \u201cwhen . . . the systematic exclusion\ntook place.\u201d Id., at 366. First, questionnaires for prospec\ntive jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out\nof jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were\nfemale, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed\nthe exemption at the questionnaire stage. Ibid. \u201cMore\nover, at the summons stage women were . . . given another\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

And if a woman\nignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out;\nno further inquiry was made. Id., at 367. At this \u201cfinal,\nvenire, stage,\u201d women\u2019s representation plummeted to\n14.5%. Ibid. In the Federal District Court serving the\nsame territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only\nchildcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of\nthose actually serving on juries. See ibid., n. 25.\n   The \u201cdisproportionate and consistent exclusion of\nwomen from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the\nvenire stage,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cwas quite obviously\ndue to the system by which juries were selected.\u201d Id., at\n367. \u201c[A]ppropriately tailored\u201d hardship exemptions, the\nCourt added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section\nchallenge if justified by an important state interest. Id.,\nat 370. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify\nMissouri\u2019s exemption for each and every woman\u2014the\naltogether evident explanation for the underrepresenta\ntion. Id., at 369\u2013370.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see\nsupra, at 6, neither Duren nor any other decision of this\nCourt specifies the method or test courts must use to\nmeasure the representation of distinctive groups in jury\npools. The courts below and the parties noted three meth\nods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions:\nabsolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard\ndeviation. See Smith, 463 Mich., at 204\u2013205, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26;\nsupra, at 6\u20137.\n   Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and compara\ntive disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can\nbe misleading when, as here, \u201cmembers of the distinctive\ngroup comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible\n\f12                      BERGHUIS v. SMITH\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor jury service.\u201d Smith, 463 Mich., at 203\u2013204, 615 N. W.\n2d, at 2\u20133. And to our knowledge, \u201c[n]o court . . . has\naccepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determi\nnative in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection\nsystems.\u201d United States v. Rioux, 97 F. 3d 648, 655 (CA2\n1996).\n  On direct review, as earlier stated, the Michigan Su\npreme Court chose no single method \u201cto measur[e]\nwhether representation was fair and reasonable.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3; see supra, at 7.\nInstead, it \u201cadopt[ed] a case-by-case approach.\u201d Smith,\n463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. \u201cProvided that the\nparties proffer sufficient evidence,\u201d that court said, \u201cthe\nresults of all of the tests [should be considered].\u201d Ibid. In\ncontrast, the Sixth Circuit declared that \u201c[w]here the\ndistinctive group alleged to have been underrepresented is\nsmall, as is the case here, the comparative disparity test is\nthe more appropriate measure of underrepresentation.\u201d\n543 F. 3d, at 338.\n  Even in the absence of AEDPA\u2019s constraint, see supra,\nat 8, we would have no cause to take sides today on the\nmethod or methods by which underrepresentation is ap\npropriately measured.4 Although the Michigan Supreme\nCourt concluded that \u201c[Smith\u2019s] statistical evidence failed\nto establish a legally significant disparity under either the\nabsolute or comparative disparity tests,\u201d Smith, 463 Mich.,\nat 204\u2013205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3,5 that court nevertheless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The State asks us to \u201cadopt the absolute-disparity standard for\n\nmeasuring fair and reasonable representation\u201d and to \u201crequir[e] proof\nthat the absolute disparity exceeds 10%\u201d to make out a prima facie fair\ncross-section violation. Brief for Petitioner 45\u201346. Under the rule the\nState proposes, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment offers no remedy for complete\nexclusion of distinct groups in communities where the population of the\ndistinct group falls below the 10 percent threshold.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 35. We need not reach that issue.\n  5 For similar conclusions, see, for example, United States v.

It did so in order to\nreach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the\nextent underrepresentation existed, was it due to \u201csystem\natic exclusion\u201d? Ibid.; see Duren, 439 U. S., at 364.\n                             B\n   Addressing the ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested\nits decision, Smith submits that the district-court-first\nassignment order systematically excluded African-\nAmericans from Kent County Circuit Court venires. Brief\nfor Respondent 46\u201348. But as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt not at all unreasonably concluded, Smith, 463\nMich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3, Smith\u2019s evidence scarcely\nshows that the assignment order he targets caused under\nrepresentation. Although the record established that\nsome officials and others in Kent County believed that the\nassignment order created racial disparities, and the\nCounty reversed the order in response, supra, at 5, the\nbelief was not substantiated by Smith\u2019s evidence.\n   Evidence that African-Americans were underrepre\nsented on the Circuit Court\u2019s venires in significantly\nhigher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District\nCourt\u2019s could have indicated that the assignment order\nmade a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme\nCourt noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.\nSee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Nor did\nSmith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the\nCounty\u2019s largest African-American population, \u201cha[d] more\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n3.57%; comparative disparities \u201crang[ing] from 38.17% to 51.22%\u201d); \n\nUnited States v. Royal, 174 F. 3d 1, 10 (CA1 1999) (2.97% absolute\n\ndisparity; 61.1% comparative disparity); United States v. Rioux, 97\n\nF. 3d 648, 657\u2013658 (CA2 1996) (2.08% absolute disparity; 29% com\nparative disparity); State v. Gibbs, 254 Conn. 578, 591\u2013593, 758 A. 2d\n327, 337\u2013338 (2000) (2.49% absolute disparity; 37% comparative\ndisparity).\n\f14                  BERGHUIS v.

Furthermore,\nSmith did not endeavor to compare the African-American\nrepresentation levels in Circuit Court venires with those\nin the Federal District Court venires for the same region.\nSee id., at 46\u201347; Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n. 25.\n  Smith\u2019s best evidence of systematic exclusion was of\nfered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in\ncomparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after\nKent County reversed the assignment order. See supra, at\n5. This evidence\u2014particularly in view of AEDPA\u2019s in\nstruction, \u00a72254(d)(2)\u2014is insufficient to support Smith\u2019s\nclaim that the assignment order caused the underrepre\nsentation. As Smith\u2019s counsel recognized at oral argu\nment, this decrease could not fairly be described as \u201ca big\nchange.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see ibid. (the drop was \u201ca\nstep in the right direction\u201d). In short, Smith\u2019s evidence\ngave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude\nthat the district-court-first assignment order had a signifi\ncantly adverse impact on the representation of African-\nAmericans on Circuit Court venires.\n                               C\n  To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the\ndefendant must show only that the underrepresentation is\npersistent and \u201cproduced by the method or \u2018system\u2019 used to\nselect [jurors],\u201d rather than by chance. Brief for Respon\ndent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list\nof factors in addition to the alleged \u201csiphoning\u201d that, he\nurges, rank as \u201csystematic\u201d causes of underrepresentation\nof African-Americans in Kent County\u2019s jury pool. Id., at\n53\u201354. Smith\u2019s list includes the County\u2019s practice of ex\ncusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply\nfailed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail\nnotices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of\nresidential addresses at least 15 months old, and the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Ibid.\n   No \u201cclearly established\u201d precedent of this Court supports\nSmith\u2019s claim that he can make out a prima facie case\nmerely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or\nin combination, might contribute to a group\u2019s underrepre\nsentation. Smith recites a sentence in our Duren opinion\nthat, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on\nthe State. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. The sentence reads:\n\u201cAssuming, arguendo, that the exemptions mentioned by\nthe court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and\ngovernment workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair\ncommunity cross section on jury venires, the State must\ndemonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the\nwomen\u2019s exemption] caused the underrepresentation\ncomplained of.\u201d 439 U. S., at 368\u2013369. That sentence\nappears after the Court had already assigned to Duren\u2014\nand found he had carried\u2014the burden of proving that the\nunderrepresentation \u201cwas due to [women\u2019s] systematic\nexclusion in the jury-selection process.\u201d Id., at 366. The\nCourt\u2019s comment, which Smith clipped from its context,\ndoes not concern the demonstration of a prima face case.\nInstead, it addresses what the State might show to rebut\nthe defendant\u2019s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt was therefore far from \u201cunreasonable,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1),\nin concluding that Duren first and foremost required\nSmith himself to show that the underrepresentation com\nplained of was \u201cdue to systematic exclusion.\u201d Id., at 364;\nsee Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.\n   This Court, furthermore, has never \u201cclearly established\u201d\nthat jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\u2019s\nlist can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim.

Argued January 19, 2010\u2014Decided March 2, 2010*\nThe Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) limits the circumstances\n  in which franchisors may \u201cterminate\u201d a service-station franchise or\n  \u201cfail to renew\u201d a franchise relationship. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72802, 2804.\n  Typically, the franchisor leases the service station to the franchisee\n  and permits the franchisee to use the franchisor\u2019s trademark and\n  purchase the franchisor\u2019s fuel for resale. \u00a72801(1). As relevant here,\n  service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging\n  that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively \u201cter\n  minate[d]\u201d their franchises and constructively \u201cfail[ed] to renew\u201d\n  their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental\n  terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for\n  many of them. The dealers asserted these claims even though they\n  had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though\n  they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements. The\n  jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District\n  Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law. The\n  First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, hold\n  ing that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its fran\n  chise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple\n  breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\n  amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a mate\n  rial change effectively ending the lease. However, the court reversed\n  as to the constructive nonrenewal claims, holding that such a claim\n  cannot be maintained once a franchisee signs and operates under a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 08\u2013372, Shell Oil Products Co.

SHELL OIL \n\n                        PRODUCTS CO.                                      \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    renewal agreement.\nHeld:\n    1. A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under\n the Act if the franchisor\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel\n the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Pp. 6\u201315.\n       (a) The Act provides that \u201cno franchisor . . . may . . . terminate\n any franchise,\u201d except for an enumerated reason and after giving\n written notice, \u00a72802(a)\u2013(b), and specifies that \u201c \u2018termination\u2019 in\n cludes cancellation,\u201d \u00a72801(17). Because it does not further define\n those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: \u201cput [to] an\n end\u201d or \u201cannul[ed] or destroy[ed].\u201d Thus, the Act prohibits only fran\n chisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise. The same\n conclusion follows even if Congress used \u201cterminate\u201d and \u201ccancel\u201d in\n their technical, rather than ordinary, senses. This conclusion is also\n consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termi\n nation doctrine as applied in analogous legal contexts\u2014e.g., employ\n ment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129,\n 141\u2013143\u2014where a termination is deemed \u201cconstructive\u201d only because\n the plaintiff, not the defendant, formally ends a particular legal rela\n tionship\u2014not because there is no end to the relationship at all. Al\n lowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a\n franchise to end would ignore the Act\u2019s scope, which is limited to the\n circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or de\n cline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state\n law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchi\n sors and franchisees, see \u00a72806(a). This conclusion is also informed\n by important practical considerations, namely, that any standard for\n identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\n tively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee continues to op\n erate, would be indeterminate and unworkable. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       (b) The dealers\u2019 claim that this interpretation of the Act fails to\n provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchi\n sor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise ignores the\n availability of state-law remedies to address such wrongful conduct.\n The Court\u2019s reading of the Act is also faithful to the statutory inter\n pretation principle that statutes should be construed \u201cin a manner\n that gives effect to all of their provisions,\u201d United States ex rel. Eisen\n stein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, because this interpreta\n tion gives meaningful effect to the Act\u2019s preliminary injunction provi\n sions and its alternative statute-of-limitations accrual dates. Pp. 12\u2013\n 14.\n    2. A franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\n with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim\n under the Act. The Act\u2019s text leaves no room for such an interpreta\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. It is violated only when a franchisor \u201cfail[s] to renew\u201d a fran\n  chise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the\n  required notice, see \u00a72802, and it defines \u201cfail to renew\u201d as a \u201cfailure\n  to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship,\u201d\n  \u00a72801(14). A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry\n  the threshold burden of showing a \u201cnonrenewal of the franchise rela\n  tionship,\u201d \u00a72805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the\n  franchisor has violated the Act. Signing their renewal agreements\n  \u201cunder protest\u201d did not preserve the dealers\u2019 ability to assert nonre\n  newal claims. When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement\u2014even\n  \u201cunder protest\u201d\u2014there has been no \u201cfail[ure] to renew,\u201d and thus no\n  violation of the Act. The Act\u2019s structure and purpose confirm this in\n  terpretation. Accepting the dealers\u2019 contrary reading would greatly\n  expand the Act\u2019s reach.

In these consolidated cases, service-station fran\nchisees brought suit under the Act, alleging that a fran\nchisor had constructively \u201cterminate[d]\u201d their franchises\nand had constructively \u201cfail[ed] to renew\u201d their franchise\nrelationships. They asserted these claims even though the\nconduct of which they complained had not compelled any\nof them to abandon their franchises and even though they\nhad been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.\nWe hold that a franchisee cannot recover for constructive\ntermination under the PMPA if the franchisor\u2019s allegedly\n\f2         MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

Additionally, we conclude that a fran\nchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement\nwith a franchisor may not maintain a claim for construc\ntive nonrenewal. We therefore reverse in part and affirm\nin part.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to\nthe public through service stations that often are operated\nby independent franchisees. In the typical franchise\narrangement, the franchisor leases the service-station\npremises to the franchisee, grants the franchisee the right\nto use the franchisor\u2019s trademark, and agrees to sell motor\nfuel to the franchisee for resale. Franchise agreements\nremain in effect for a stated term, after which the parties\ncan opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a\nnew agreement.\n  Enacted in 1978, the PMPA was a response to wide\nspread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly un\nfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petro\nleum industry. See, e.g., Comment, 1980 Duke L. J. 522,\n524\u2013531. The Act establishes minimum federal standards\ngoverning the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchises. Under the Act\u2019s operative provisions, a fran\nchisor may \u201cterminate\u201d a \u201cfranchise\u201d during the term\nstated in the franchise agreement and may \u201cfail to renew\u201d\na \u201cfranchise relationship\u201d at the conclusion of that term\nonly if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the\naction in question for a reason specifically recognized in\nthe statute. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72802, 2804. Consistent with the\ntypical franchise arrangement, a \u201cfranchise\u201d is defined as\n\u201cany contract\u201d that authorizes a franchisee to use the\nfranchisor\u2019s trademark, as well as any associated agree\nment providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

The Act defines a \u201cfranchise rela\ntionship\u201d in more general terms: the parties\u2019 \u201crespective\nmotor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and re\nsponsibilities\u201d that result from the franchise arrangement.\n\u00a72801(2).\n   To enforce these provisions, a franchisee may bring suit\nin federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply\nwith the Act\u2019s restrictions on terminations and nonrenew\nals. See \u00a72805. Successful franchisees can benefit from a\nwide range of remedies, including compensatory and\npunitive damages, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expert\ncosts, and equitable relief. See \u00a72805(b), (d). The Act also\nrequires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive\nrelief to aggrieved franchisees, if there are \u201csufficiently\nserious questions going to the merits\u201d that present \u201ca fair\nground for litigation\u201d and the balance of hardships favors\nsuch relief. \u00a72805(b)(2).\n                             B\n  This litigation involves a dispute between Shell Oil\nCompany (Shell), a petroleum franchisor, and several\nShell franchisees in Massachusetts.2 Pursuant to their\nfranchise agreements with Shell, each franchisee was\nrequired to pay Shell monthly rent for use of the service\nstation premises. For many years, Shell offered the fran\nchisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a\nset amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold\nabove a specified threshold. Shell renewed the subsidy\nannually through notices that \u201cexplicitly provided for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Courts sometimes describe these three types of agreements as the\n\n\u201cstatutory elements\u201d of a petroleum franchise.

Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various\noral representations to the franchisees \u201cthat the [s]ubsidy\nor something like it would always exist.\u201d Ibid.\n   In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to\ncreate Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture\nthat combined the companies\u2019 petroleum-marketing opera\ntions in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell as\nsigned to Motiva its rights and obligations under the\nrelevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two\nactions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1,\n2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus\nincreasing the franchisees\u2019 rent. Id., at 38. Second, as\neach franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the\nfranchisees new agreements that contained a different\nformula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the\nfranchisees, annual rent was greater under the new\nformula.\n                             C\n   In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers)\nfiled suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District\nCourt. Their complaint alleged that Motiva\u2019s discontinua\ntion of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract\nunder state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two\nclaims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell\nand Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had \u201ccon\nstructively terminated\u201d their franchises in violation of the\nAct. Second, they claimed that Motiva\u2019s offer of new fran\nchise agreements that calculated rent using a different\nformula amounted to a \u201cconstructive nonrenewal\u201d of their\nfranchise relationships.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dealers also claimed that Shell and Motiva had violated the\n\nUniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting\nunreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   After a 2-week trial involving eight of the dealers, the\njury found against Shell and Motiva on all claims. Both\nbefore and after the jury\u2019s verdict, Shell and Motiva moved\nfor judgment as a matter of law on the dealers\u2019 two PMPA\nclaims. They argued that they could not be found liable\nfor constructive termination under the Act because none of\nthe dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to\nMotiva\u2019s elimination of the rent subsidy\u2013\u2013something Shell\nand Motiva said was a necessary element of any construc\ntive termination claim. Similarly, they argued that the\ndealers\u2019 constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed\nbecause seven of the eight dealers had signed and oper\nated under renewal agreements with Motiva, and the\neighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his\nfranchise agreement. The District Court denied these\nmotions, and Shell and Motiva appealed.\n   The First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nIn affirming the judgment on the dealers\u2019 constructive\ntermination claims, the Court of Appeals held that a fran\nchisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover\nfor constructive termination under the PMPA. See 524\nF. 3d, at 45\u201347. Instead, the court ruled, a simple breach\nof contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can\namount to constructive termination under the Act, so long\nas the breach resulted in \u201csuch a material change that it\neffectively ended the lease, even though the [franchisee]\ncontinued to operate [its franchise].\u201d Id., at 46 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Turning to the dealers\u2019 con\nstructive nonrenewal claims, the First Circuit agreed with\nShell and Motiva that a franchisee cannot maintain a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA \u201cwhere\nthe franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nagreements with the dealers. The jury found in favor of the dealers on \n\nthis claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 524 F. 3d, at 51. That\n\nissue is not before us. \n\n\f6               MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  The first question we are asked to decide is whether a\nservice-station franchisee may recover for constructive\ntermination under the PMPA when the franchisor\u2019s alleg\nedly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to\nabandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we\nconclude that a necessary element of any constructive\ntermination claim under the Act is that the franchisor\u2019s\nconduct forced an end to the franchisee\u2019s use of the fran\nchisor\u2019s trademark, purchase of the franchisor\u2019s fuel, or\noccupation of the franchisor\u2019s service station.4\n                             A\n  When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA\nprohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect\nof ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides\nthat \u201cno franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,\u201d\nexcept for an enumerated reason and after providing\nwritten notice. 15 U. S. C. \u00a72802(a)\u2013(b). The Act specifies\nthat \u201c[t]he term \u2018termination\u2019 includes cancellation,\u201d\n\u00a72801(17), but it does not further define the term \u201ctermi\nnate\u201d or the incorporated term \u201ccancel.\u201d We therefore give\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 Becauseresolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases,\nwe need not address Shell and Motiva\u2019s alternative argument that the\nPMPA does not embrace claims for constructive termination at all.\nSeveral Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of\naction for constructive termination. See, e.g., 524 F. 3d, at 44\u201345 (case\nbelow); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F. 3d 386, 390\u2013391 (CA6 1998); Shukla\nv. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 115 F. 3d 849, 852\u2013853 (CA11 1997).\nOthers have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v.\nShell Oil Co., 343 F. 3d 482, 486\u2013488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76\nAuto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F. 3d 938, 948\n(CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

S. 179, 187 (1995).\n   The word \u201cterminate\u201d ordinarily means \u201cput an end to.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.\n1957); see also The Random House Dictionary of the Eng\nlish Language 1465 (1967). The term \u201ccancel\u201d carries a\nsimilar meaning: to \u201cannul or destroy.\u201d Webster\u2019s, supra,\nat 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (\u201cto make\nvoid; revoke; annul\u201d). The object of the verb \u201cterminate\u201d is\nthe noun \u201cfranchise,\u201d a term the Act defines as \u201cany con\ntract\u201d for the provision of one (or more) of the three ele\nments of a typical petroleum franchise. \u00a72801(1). Thus,\nwhen given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only\nif an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of\nmotor fuel, or lease of a premises is \u201cput [to] an end\u201d or\n\u201cannul[ed] or destroy[ed].\u201d Conduct that does not force an\nend to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the\nAct\u2019s plain terms.\n   The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using\nthe words \u201cterminate\u201d and \u201ccancel\u201d in their technical,\nrather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the\nPMPA, those terms had established meanings under the\nUniform Commercial Code.5          Under both definitions,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  difference between a \u201ctermination\u201d and a \u201ccancellation\u201d under\nthe Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party\njustifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A \u201ctermination\u201d\noccurs when \u201ceither party pursuant to a power created by agreement or\nlaw puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.\u201d U. C. C.\n\u00a72\u2013106(3) (1972 ed.). By contrast, a \u201ccancellation\u201d occurs when \u201ceither\nparty puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.\u201d \u00a72\u2013106(4).\n  That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to\nspecify that \u201ccancellation[s],\u201d no less than \u201ctermination[s],\u201d are covered\nby the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their\ngreater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or\ntechnical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc.\nv. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F. 2d 744, 746\u2013747 (CA1 1991). By\nspecifying that the Act covers \u201ccancellation[s]\u201d as well as \u201ctermina\n\f8           MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                  \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhowever, a \u201ctermination\u201d or \u201ccancellation\u201d occurs only\nwhen a contracting party \u201cputs an end to the contract.\u201d\nU. C. C. \u00a72\u2013106(3)\u2013(4) (1972 ed.); see also U. C. C. \u00a72\u2013\n106(3)\u2013(4), 1 U. L. A. 695, 695\u2013696 (2004). Thus, a fran\nchisee who continues operating a franchise\u2014occupying the\nsame premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the\nsame trademark\u2014has not had the franchise \u201ctermi\nnate[d]\u201d in either the ordinary or technical sense of the\nword.\n  Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before\nclaiming constructive termination is also consistent with\nthe general understanding of the doctrine of constructive\ntermination. As applied in analogous legal contexts\u2014both\nnow and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA\u2014a\nplaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship\nin order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.\nFor example, courts have long recognized a theory of\nconstructive discharge in the field of employment law. See\nPennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141\u2013\n143 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930\u2019s). To recover\nfor constructive discharge, however, an employee gener\nally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann\n& P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1449\n(4th ed. 2007); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law\n\u00a759.05[8] (2009); 2 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7612.9(a)\n(2008); cf. Suders, supra, at 141\u2013143, 148; Young v. South\nwestern Savings & Loan Assn., 509 F. 2d 140, 144 (CA5\n1975); Muller v. United States Steel Corp., 509 F. 2d 923,\n929 (CA10 1975). Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long\nrecognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Ra\npacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the\nUnited States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntion[s],\u201d Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for \n\nbreach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a \u201ccancella\n\ntion\u201d rather than a \u201ctermination.\u201d \n\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually\nmove out in order to claim constructive eviction. See id.,\nat 75; Glendon, The Transformation of American Land\nlord-Tenant Law, 23 Boston College L. Rev. 503, 513\u2013514\n(1982); 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7\u00a7141, 143 (3d ed.\n1939).6\n   As generally understood in these and other contexts, a\ntermination is deemed \u201cconstructive\u201d because it is the\nplaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an\nend to the particular legal relationship\u2014not because there\nis no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why\na different understanding should apply to constructive\ntermination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it\nenacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of\nhow courts applied the doctrine of constructive termina\ntion in these analogous legal contexts. See Fitzgerald v.\nBarnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop, at 11\u201312). And in the absence of any contrary evi\ndence, we think it reasonable to interpret the Act in a way\nthat is consistent with this well-established body of law.\n   The Court of Appeals was of the view that analogizing to\ndoctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was\ninappropriate because \u201csunk costs, optimism, and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Before Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true,\nhad held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain\ndeclaratory relief without abandoning the premises\u2014although the court\nobserved that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in\norder to obtain rescission. See Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand\nCorp., 340 Mass. 124, 129\u2013130, 163 N. E. 2d 4, 7\u20138 (1959). But as even\nthe dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338, the clear majority of\nauthority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming\nconstructive eviction.\n  For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help\nto the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive\neviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was\n\u201ccontrary to the present weight of judicial authority.\u201d 1 Restatement\n(Second) of Property \u00a76.1, Reporter\u2019s Note 1, p. 230 (1976).\n\f10        MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhabit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the\nnew arrangements work, even when the terms have\nchanged so materially as to make success impossible.\u201d 524\nF. 3d, at 46. But surely these same factors compel em\nployees and tenants\u2014no less than service-station franchi\nsees\u2014to try to make their changed arrangements work.\nNonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting\nsuch claims to show an actual severance of the relevant\nlegal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule\nhere.\n  Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief\nfor conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would\nextend the reach of the Act much further than its text and\nstructure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petro\nleum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state\nlaw. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d\n846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277\u2013\n283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not\nregulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relation\nship but instead federalized only the two parts of that\nrelationship with which it was most concerned: the cir\ncumstances in which franchisors may terminate a fran\nchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15\nU. S. C. \u00a72802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861\u2013862. Con\ngress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types\nof disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchi\nsees. See \u00a72806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws\ngoverning franchise terminations or nonrenewals).\n  The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a\nmanner that ignores the Act\u2019s limited scope. On their\nview, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA\nprohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenew\nals, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do\nnot cause an end to the franchise. See Brief for Respon\ndents in No. 08\u2013372, pp. 28\u201335 (hereinafter Respondents\u2019\nBrief); 524 F. 3d, at 44\u201347. Reading the Act to prohibit\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsimple breaches of contract, however, would be inconsis\ntent with the Act\u2019s limited purpose and would further\nexpand federal law into a domain traditionally reserved\nfor the States. Without a clearer indication that Congress\nintended to federalize such a broad swath of the law gov\nerning petroleum franchise agreements, we decline to\nadopt an interpretation of the Act that would have such\nsweeping consequences. See, e.g., United States v. Bass,\n404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).7\n   Finally, important practical considerations inform our\ndecision. Adopting the dealers\u2019 reading of the PMPA\nwould require us to articulate a standard for identifying\nthose breaches of contract that should be treated as effec\ntively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee in\nfact continues to use the franchisor\u2019s trademark, purchase\nthe franchisor\u2019s fuel, and occupy the service-station prem\nises.8 We think any such standard would be indetermi\nnate and unworkable. How is a court to determine\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Adopting such a broad reading of the PMPA also would have serious\n\nimplications for run-of-the-mill franchise disputes. The Act requires\ncourts to award attorney\u2019s fees and expert-witness fees in any case in\nwhich a plaintiff recovers more than nominal damages. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a72805(d)(1)(C). The Act also permits punitive damages, \u00a72805(d)(1)(B),\na remedy ordinarily not available in breach-of-contract actions, see\nBarnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 187\u2013188 (2002). Accepting the\ndealers\u2019 reading of the statute, therefore, would turn everyday contract\ndisputes into high-stakes affairs.\n  8 The First Circuit, for example, approved of a test that asks whether\n\nthe breach resulted in \u201csuch a material change that it effectively ended\nthe lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate [their fran\nchises].\u201d 524 F. 3d, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). That\nstandard, it seems to us, does little more than restate the relevant\nquestion. While we do not decide whether the PMPA contemplates\nclaims for constructive termination, we observe that the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 unwillingness or inability to establish a more concrete stan\ndard underscores the difficulties and inherent contradictions involved\nin crafting a standard for finding a \u201ctermination\u201d when no termination\nhas in fact occurred.\n\f12        MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                         \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a\nfranchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to\ncontinue its operations? And how is a franchisor to know\nin advance which breaches a court will later determine to\nhave been so serious? The dealers have not provided\nanswers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard\nfor identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts\nto a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements\nremain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.\n                              B\n   The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the\nPMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed\nprotection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct\nthat does not force an end to the franchise. That argu\nment, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have\nstate-law remedies available to them. The pre-emptive\nscope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only\nthose state or local laws that govern the termination of\npetroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum\nfranchise relationships. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a72806(a). Outside\nof those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on\nstate-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct\nthat does not have the effect of ending the franchise.\nIndeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers\nargued in the District Court that Motiva\u2019s elimination of\nthe rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their\nfranchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to\na breach of contract under state law. The jury found in\ntheir favor on their state-law claims and awarded them\nalmost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376\u2013379. Thus,\nthe dealers\u2019 own experience demonstrates that franchisees\ndo not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protec\ntion from abusive franchisor conduct.\n   The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the\nPMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provi\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

While we agree that we normally should construe\nstatutes \u201cin a manner that gives effect to all of their provi\nsions,\u201d we believe our interpretation is faithful to this\n\u201cwell-established principl[e] of statutory interpretation.\u201d\nUnited States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)\n   To begin, the dealers insist that our reading of the term\n\u201cterminate\u201d will require franchisees to go out of business\nbefore they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will\nrender useless the Act\u2019s preliminary injunction mecha\nnism. We disagree. To obtain a preliminary injunction, it\nis true, a franchisee must show, among other things, that\n\u201cthe franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.\u201d\n15 U. S. C. \u00a72805(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). But that\ndoes not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of\nbusiness before obtaining an injunction. For example, in\ncases of actual termination, the Act requires franchisors to\nprovide franchisees with written notice of termination well\nin advance of the date on which the termination \u201ctakes\neffect.\u201d \u00a72804(a). A franchisee that receives notice of\ntermination \u201chas been terminated\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a72805(b)(2)(A)(i), even though the termination \u201ctakes\neffect\u201d on a later date, just as an employee who receives\nnotice of discharge can be accurately described as having\nbeen discharged, even though the employee\u2019s last day at\nwork may perhaps be weeks later. Thus, franchisees that\nreceive notice of impending termination can invoke the\nprotections of the Act\u2019s preliminary injunction mechanism\nwell before having to go out of business.9 Contrary to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The Government reads the Act to permit a dealer to seek prelimi\n\nnary injunctive relief if a franchisor announces its \u201cintent to engage in\nconduct that would leave the franchisee no reasonable alternative but\nto abandon\u201d one (or more) of the franchise elements. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21. Because we do not decide whether the\nPMPA permits constructive termination claims at all, see n. 4, supra,\n\f14          MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                   \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndealers\u2019 assertions, therefore, our interpretation of the Act\ngives meaningful effect to the PMPA\u2019s preliminary injunc\ntion provisions.\n   Our interpretation also gives effect to the Act\u2019s alterna\ntive statute-of-limitations accrual dates. The 1-year limi\ntations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later\nof either (1) \u201cthe date of termination of the franchise\u201d or\n(2) \u201cthe date the franchisor fails to comply with the re\nquirements of\u201d the Act. \u00a72805(a). Some violations of the\nPMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has\nbeen terminated. See, e.g., \u00a72802(d)(1) (franchisor must\nshare with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation\naward when the termination was the result of a condem\nnation or taking); \u00a72802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a\nfranchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was\nterminated due to the destruction of the service station\nand the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second ac\ncrual date listed in \u00a72805(a), therefore, shows only that\nthe limitations period runs from the date of these types of\npost-termination violations. It does not suggest that\nCongress intended franchisees to maintain claims under\nthe PMPA to redress franchisor conduct that does not\nforce an end to the franchise.\n                         *     *    *\n  We therefore hold that a necessary element of any con\nstructive termination claim under the PMPA is that the\ncomplained-of conduct forced an end to the franchisee\u2019s\nuse of the franchisor\u2019s trademark, purchase of the franchi\nsor\u2019s fuel, or occupation of the franchisor\u2019s service station.\nBecause none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned\nany element of their franchise operations in response to\nMotiva\u2019s elimination of the rent subsidy,10 they cannot\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwe need not address this argument.\n  10 After Motiva withdrew the rent subsidy, seven of the dealers con\n\ntinued operating their franchises for the full terms of their franchise\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

For reasons similar to those\ngiven above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a\nfranchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement\ncannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal\nunder the Act.11\n  The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a fran\nchisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nagreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the\nsubsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316\u2013321 (Mac\u2019s Shell Service, Inc.); id., at\n138\u2013139, 314\u2013315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154\u2013155, 310\u2013311 (Akmal,\nInc.); id., at 185\u2013186, 268\u2013269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312\u2013313 (J &\nM Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179\u2013182, 322\u2013323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at\n148\u2013153, 324\u2013325 (John A. Sullivan). These dealers necessarily cannot\nestablish that the elimination of the subsidy \u201cterminate[d]\u201d their\nfranchises \u201cprior to the conclusion of the term\u201d stated in their franchise\nagreements. 15 U. S. C. \u00a72802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations\nafter their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant.\nIndeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for\nconstructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agree\nments. See Appellees\u2019 Brief in No. 05\u20132770 etc. (CA1), p. 40, n. 29.\n  One dealer did leave his franchise before his franchise agreement\nexpired. App. 204, 330\u2013331 (Stephen Pisarczyk). But that dealer not\nonly continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id.,\nat 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with\nMotiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330\u2013331.\nMoreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station\nbusiness before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed\nthat his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva\u2019s rent policies.\nSee id., at 202\u2013207.\n  11 As is true with respect to the dealers\u2019 constructive termination\n\nclaims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the\nAct at all recognizes claims for \u201cconstructive nonrenewal.\u201d We there\nfore do not express a view on that question.\n\f16        MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                     PRODUCTS CO.                           \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto renew a franchise relationship\u2014constructively or oth\nerwise\u2014when the franchisee has in fact accepted a new\nfranchise agreement. As relevant here, a franchisor vio\nlates the PMPA only when it \u201cfail[s] to renew\u201d a franchise\nrelationship for a reason not provided for in the Act or\nafter not providing the required notice. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a72802. The Act defines the term \u201cfail to renew,\u201d in turn,\nas a \u201cfailure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise\nrelationship.\u201d \u00a72801(14). Thus, the threshold require\nment of any unlawful nonrenewal action\u2014a requirement\nthe franchisee bears the burden of establishing, see\n\u00a72805(c)\u2014is that the franchisor did not \u201creinstate, con\ntinue, or renew\u201d the franchise relationship once a fran\nchise agreement expired. But if a franchisee signs a re\nnewal agreement, the franchisor clearly has \u201creinstate[d],\ncontinue[d], or extend[ed]\u201d the franchise relationship.\nTrue, the franchisee might find some of the terms in the\nnew agreement objectionable. But the Act prohibits only\nunlawful \u201cfail[ures] to renew\u201d a franchise relationship, not\nrenewals of a franchise relationship on terms that are less\nthan favorable to the franchisee. A franchisee that signs a\nrenewal agreement, in short, cannot carry the threshold\nburden of showing a \u201cnonrenewal of the franchise rela\ntionship,\u201d \u00a72805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish\nthat the franchisor has violated the Act.\n   The dealers point out that several of them signed their\nrenewal agreements \u201cunder protest,\u201d and they argue that\nthey thereby explicitly preserved their ability to assert a\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. That\nargument misunderstands the legal significance of signing\na renewal agreement. Signing a renewal agreement does\nnot constitute a waiver of a franchisee\u2019s legal rights\u2014\nsomething that signing \u201cunder protest\u201d can sometimes\nhelp avoid. See, e.g., U. C. C. \u00a71\u2013207, 1 U. L. A. 318.\nInstead, signing a renewal agreement negates the very\npossibility of a violation of the PMPA. When a franchisee\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsigns a renewal agreement\u2014even \u201cunder protest\u201d\u2014there\nhas been no \u201cfail[ure] to renew,\u201d and thus the franchisee\nhas no cause of action under the Act. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a72805(a).\n   The Act\u2019s structure and purpose confirm this interpreta\ntion. By requiring franchisors to renew only the \u201cfranchise\nrelationship,\u201d as opposed to the same franchise agreement,\nsee \u00a72802; see also \u00a72801(2), the PMPA contemplates that\nfranchisors can respond to market demands by proposing\nnew and different terms at the expiration of a franchise\nagreement. To that end, the Act authorizes franchisors to\ndecline to renew a franchise relationship if the franchisee\nrefuses to accept changes or additions that are proposed\n\u201cin good faith and in the normal course of business\u201d and\nthat are not designed to convert the service station to\ndirect operation by the franchisor. \u00a72802(b)(3)(A). Addi\ntionally, the Act creates a procedural mechanism for re\nsolving disputes over the legality of proposed new terms.\nIf the parties cannot agree, the franchisor has the option\nof either modifying the objectionable terms or pursuing\nnonrenewal, in which case it must provide the franchisee\nwith written notice well in advance of the date when the\nnonrenewal takes effect. \u00a72804(a)(2). Once the franchisee\nreceives notice of nonrenewal, it can seek a preliminary\ninjunction under the Act\u2019s relaxed injunctive standard,\nmaintaining the status quo while a court determines the\nlawfulness of the proposed changes. See \u00a72805(b)(2);\nsupra, at 13.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The availability of preliminary injunctive relief under the Act also\nexplains why the dealers are wrong to suggest that our holding will\nforce franchisees \u201cto choose between accepting an unlawful and coercive\ncontract in order to stay in business [or] rejecting it and going out of\nbusiness in order to preserve a cause of action.\u201d Respondents\u2019 Brief 51\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A franchisee presented with\n\u201cunlawful and coercive\u201d terms can simply reject those terms and, if the\nfranchisor pursues nonrenewal, seek a preliminary injunction under\n\f18          MAC\u2019S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL \n\n                       PRODUCTS CO.                                     \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   Allowing franchisees to pursue nonrenewal claims even\nafter they have signed renewal agreements would under\nmine this procedural mechanism and, in the process,\nwould frustrate franchisors\u2019 ability to propose new terms.\nUnder the dealers\u2019 theory, franchisees have no incentive to\nobject to burdensome new terms and seek a preliminary\ninjunction if a franchisor pursues nonrenewal. Instead, a\nfranchisee could simply sign the new franchise agreement\nand decide later whether to sue under the PMPA. Fran\nchisees would then have the option of either continuing to\noperate under the new agreement or, if the terms of the\nagreement later proved unfavorable, bringing suit under\nthe PMPA alleging that the newly imposed terms are\nunlawful. And because the PMPA has a 1-year statute of\nlimitations, see \u00a72805(a), franchisees would retain that\noption for the entire first year of a new franchise agree\nment. Accepting the dealers\u2019 argument, therefore, would\ncast a cloud of uncertainty over all renewal agreements\nand could chill franchisors from proposing new terms in\nresponse to changing market conditions and consumer\nneeds.\n   Finally, accepting the dealers\u2019 argument would greatly\nexpand the PMPA\u2019s reach. Under the balance struck by\nthe plain text of the statute, a franchisee faced with objec\ntionable new terms must decide whether challenging those\nterms is worth risking the nonrenewal of the franchise\nrelationship; if the franchisee rejects the terms and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Act once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal. Indeed, the\nPMPA substantially relaxes the normal standard for obtaining prelimi\nnary-injunctive relief, \u00a72805(b)(2)(A)(ii), thus allowing a franchisee\nwith anything close to a meritorious claim to obtain relief.\n  It is possible, of course, that a franchisor could fail to renew a fran\nchise relationship without providing the statutorily required notice.\nBut in that circumstance, a franchisee would not only have a surefire\nclaim for unlawful nonrenewal, see \u00a72802(b)(1)(A), but also presumably\ncould seek a preliminary injunction forcing the franchisor to resume\nproviding the franchise elements for the duration of the litigation.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfranchisor seeks nonrenewal, the franchisee runs the risk\nthat a court will ultimately determine that the proposed\nterms were lawful under the PMPA. See \u00a72802(b)(3)(A).\nThat risk acts as a restraint, limiting the scope of franchi\nsor liability under the Act to that with which Congress\nwas most concerned: the imposition of arbitrary and un\nreasonable new terms on a franchisee that are designed to\nforce an end to the petroleum franchise relationship. See,\ne.g., ibid.; Comment, 32 Emory L. J., at 277\u2013283. Allow\ning franchisees both to sign a franchise agreement and to\npursue a claim under the PMPA would eliminate that\nrestraint and thus permit franchisees to challenge a much\nbroader range of franchisor conduct\u2014conduct to which the\ndealer might object but not consider so serious as to risk\nthe nonrenewal of the franchise by mounting a legal chal\nlenge. As explained, the PMPA was enacted to address\nthe narrow areas of franchise terminations and nonre\nnewals, not to govern every aspect of the petroleum fran\nchise relationship. See supra, at 10; Dersch Energies, 314\nF. 3d, at 861. We thus decline to adopt an interpretation\nthat would expand the Act in such a fashion.13\n                      *    *    *\n  We hold that a franchisee who is offered and signs a\nrenewed franchise agreement cannot maintain a claim for\nunlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 It also is worth noting that, although the concept of \u201cconstructive\n\nnonrenewal\u201d does not arise frequently in other areas of the law, the\nlittle authority on this concept supports our conclusion that a plaintiff\nwho signs a new agreement cannot maintain a claim for constructive\nnonrenewal.

Argued January 13, 2010\u2014Decided April 21, 2010\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692 et\n  seq., imposes civil liability on \u201cdebt collector[s]\u201d for certain prohibited\n  debt collection practices. A debt collector who \u201cfails to comply with\n  any [FDCPA] provision . . . with respect to any person is liable to\n  such person\u201d for \u201cactual damage[s],\u201d costs, \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s\n  fee as determined by the court,\u201d and statutory \u201cadditional damages.\u201d\n  \u00a71692k(a). In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or\n  deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act\n  (FTC Act), \u00a741 et seq., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Com\n  mission (FTC). See \u00a71692l. A debt collector who acts with \u201cactual\n  knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective cir\n  cumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]\u201d is subject\n  to civil penalties enforced by the FTC. \u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A), (C). A debt col\n  lector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however,\n  if it \u201cshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not\n  intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n  maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such er\n  ror.\u201d \u00a71692k(c).\n     Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Car\n  lisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage com\n  pany to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner\n  Jerman.

Jer\n  man\u2019s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mort\n  gage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Car\n  lisle withdrew the suit. Jerman then filed this action, contending\n  that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writ\n\f2               JERMAN v.

The District Court, acknowledging a\n    division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated\n    \u00a71692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under\n    \u00a71692k(c)\u2019s \u201cbona fide error\u201d defense. The Sixth Circuit affirmed,\n    holding that the defense in \u00a71692k(c) is not limited to clerical or fac\n    tual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.\nHeld: The bona fide error defense in \u00a71692k(c) does not apply to a viola\n tion resulting from a debt collector\u2019s mistaken interpretation of the\n legal requirements of the FDCPA. Pp. 6\u201330.\n    (a) A violation resulting from a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation of\n the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be \u201cnot intentional\u201d un\n der \u00a71692k(c). It is a common maxim that \u201cignorance of the law will\n not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u201d Barlow v. United\n States, 7 Pet. 404, 411. When Congress has intended to provide a\n mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more ex\n plicitly than here. In particular, the administrative-penalty provi\n sions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the\n FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with \u201cactual knowledge\n or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\u201d\n that the FDCPA prohibited its action. \u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the\n absence of similar language in \u00a71692k(c), it is fair to infer that Con\n gress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for \u201cinten\n tional\u201d conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken inter\n pretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous\n administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions\n reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited. Congress also\n did not confine FDCPA liability to \u201cwillful\u201d violations, a term more of\n ten understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law. See,\n e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125\u2013126.\n Section 1692k(c)\u2019s requirement that a debt collector maintain \u201cproce\n dures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error\u201d also more natu\n rally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual er\n rors. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statute\u2019s con\n text and history. The FDCPA\u2019s separate protection from liability for\n \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC]\n advisory opinion,\u201d \u00a71692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the con\n cern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPA\u2019s prohibitions\n are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense. Moreover, in enact\n ing the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the\n bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA),\n \u00a71640(c). At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have\n considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress dis\n  agreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILA\u2019s lan\n  guage into the FDCPA. Although in 1980 Congress amended the de\n  fense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal\n  judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the\n  TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial\n  interpretation of that provision. It is also unclear why Congress\n  would have intended the FDCPA\u2019s defense to be broader than TILA\u2019s,\n  and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of\n  the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.\n  Carlisle\u2019s reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n  291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the\n  FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the\n  premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA\n  would fall under that provision. Pp. 13\u201322.\n     (c) Today\u2019s decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt\n  collecting lawyers. The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly\n  guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in cal\n  culating additional damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Lawyers have re\n  course to the bona fide error defense in \u00a71692k(c) when a violation\n  results from a qualifying factual error. To the extent the FDCPA im\n  poses some constraints on a lawyer\u2019s advocacy on behalf of a client, it\n  is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the\n  law and standards of professional conduct. Numerous state con\n  sumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error\n  defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal er\n  rors. To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations\n  of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that \u201cthe result\n  [will be] so absurd as to warrant\u201d disregarding the weight of textual\n  authority. Heintz, supra, at 295. Absent such a showing, arguments\n  that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks\n  of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.\n  Pp. 22\u201330.\n538 F. 3d 469, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

CARLISLE, MC-\n\n   NELLIE, RINI, KRAMER & ULRICH LPA, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 21, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act)\nimposes civil liability on \u201cdebt collector[s]\u201d for certain\nprohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the\nAct, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(c), provides that a debt collector is\nnot liable in an action brought under the Act if she can\nshow \u201cthe violation was not intentional and resulted from\na bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d\nThis case presents the question whether the \u201cbona fide\nerror\u201d defense in \u00a71692k(c) applies to a violation resulting\nfrom a debt collector\u2019s mistaken interpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to\neliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that\ndebt collectors who abstain from such practices are not\ncompetitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent\nstate action to protect consumers. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692(e).\nThe Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors\n\f2          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand \u201cdebt collector[s],\u201d defined to include any person who\n\u201cregularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be\nowed or due another.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71692a(5), (6). Among other\nthings, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false\nrepresentations as to a debt\u2019s character, amount, or legal\nstatus, \u00a71692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an\n\u201cunusual time or place\u201d likely to be inconvenient to the\nconsumer, \u00a71692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan\nguage or violence or the threat thereof, \u00a7\u00a71692d(1), (2).\nSee generally \u00a7\u00a71692b\u20131692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n291, 292\u2013293 (1995).\n   The Act is enforced through administrative action and\nprivate lawsuits. With some exceptions not relevant here,\nviolations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or decep\ntive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission\nAct (FTC Act), 15 U. S. C. \u00a741 et seq., and are enforced by\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See \u00a71692l. As a\nresult, a debt collector who acts with \u201cactual knowledge or\nknowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]\u201d is\nsubject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.\n\u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16\nCFR \u00a71.98(d)).\n   The FDCPA also provides that \u201cany debt collector who\nfails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with re\nspect to any person is liable to such person.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cactual\ndamage[s],\u201d plus costs and \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as\ndetermined by the court.\u201d Ibid. A court may also award\n\u201cadditional damages,\u201d subject to a statutory cap of $1,000\nfor individual actions, or, for class actions, \u201cthe lesser of\n$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt\ncollector.\u201d \u00a71692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,\nthe court must consider \u201cthe frequency and persistence of\n[the debt collector\u2019s] noncompliance,\u201d \u201cthe nature of such\nnoncompliance,\u201d and \u201cthe extent to which such noncompli\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Section 1692k(c), at issue here,\nprovides that\n    \u201c[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows\n    by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was\n    not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\n    notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures rea\n    sonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d\nThe Act also states that none of its provisions imposing\nliability shall apply to \u201cany act done or omitted in good\nfaith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Fed\neral Trade] Commission.\u201d \u00a71692k(e).\n                             B\n  Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its\nattorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In\nApril 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court\non behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.\nCarlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Coun\ntrywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L.\nJerman. The complaint included a \u201cNotice,\u201d later served\non Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be as\nsumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.\nJerman\u2019s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and\nCarlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When\nCountrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact,\nalready paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the fore\nclosure lawsuit.\n  Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certifi\ncation and damages under the FDCPA, contending that\nCarlisle violated \u00a71692g by stating that her debt would be\n\f4             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nassumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.1 While\nacknowledging a division of authority on the question, the\nDistrict Court held that Carlisle had violated \u00a71692g by\nrequiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing. 464\nF. Supp. 2d 720, 722\u2013725 (ND Ohio 2006).2 The court\nultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, how\never, concluding that \u00a71692k(c) shielded it from liability\nbecause the violation was not intentional, resulted from a\nbona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\n502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695\u2013697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469\n(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are\ndivided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,\nand that the \u201cmajority view is that the defense is available\nfor clerical and factual errors only,\u201d the Sixth Circuit\nnonetheless held that \u00a71692k(c) extends to \u201cmistakes of\nlaw.\u201d Id., at 473\u2013476 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Court of Appeals found \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about\nattorney debt collectors maintaining \u201cprocedures\u201d within\nthe meaning of \u00a71692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at\n476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an\n\n\u201cinitial communication\u201d about the collection of a debt, to send the\nconsumer a written notice containing, inter alia, \u201ca statement that\nunless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,\ndisputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be\nassumed to be valid by the debt collector.\u201d\n  2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,\n\n950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer\u2019s dispute of a\ndebt under \u00a71692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that\ndistrict courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,\nand distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which\nCarlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the\ncourt adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,\nInc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080\u20131082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain\nlanguage of \u00a71692g does not impose an \u201cin writing\u201d requirement on\nconsumers.

We likewise ex\npress no view about whether inclusion of an \u201cin writing\u201d requirement in\na notice to a consumer violates \u00a71692g, as that question was not pre\nsented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112\n(reading \u00a71692g(a)(3) to require that \u201cany dispute, to be effective, must\nbe in writing\u201d), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under \u00a71692g(a)(3),\n\u201cdisputes need not be made in writing\u201d).\n   4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v. G. C.\n\nServs. Corp., 677 F. 2d 775, 779 (CA9 1982), and Hulshizer v. Global\nCredit Servs., Inc., 728 F. 2d 1037, 1038 (CA8 1984) (per curiam).\n   The Courts of Appeals have also expressed different views about\nwhether 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(c) applies to violations of the FDCPA\nresulting from a misinterpretation of the requirements of state law.\nCompare Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con\ncluding that \u00a71692k(c) applies where a debt collector\u2019s misinterpreta\ntion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of\n\u00a71692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not \u201cpermitted by\nlaw\u201d), with Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd., 236 F. 3d 446, 451\u2013452 (CA8\n2001) (stating that \u00a71692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability result\ning from a creditor\u2019s mistaken legal interpretation of a Minnesota\ngarnishment statute). The parties disagree about whether \u00a71692k(c)\napplies when a violation results from a debt collector\u2019s misinterpreta\ntion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the\nFDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47\u201349, with Brief for Respon\ndents 60\u201362. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpreta\ntion of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach\nthose other questions.\n\f6             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   The parties disagree about whether a \u201cviolation\u201d result\ning from a debt collector\u2019s misinterpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA can ever be \u201cnot intentional\u201d\nunder \u00a71692k(c). Jerman contends that when a debt\ncollector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the\nviolation (here, sending a notice that included the \u201cin\nwriting\u201d language), a misunderstanding about what the\nAct requires cannot render the violation \u201cnot intentional,\u201d\ngiven the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is\nno defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue\nthat nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors\nfrom the category of \u201cbona fide error[s]\u201d covered by\n\u00a71692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an uninten\ntional \u201cact\u201d but rather an unintentional \u201cviolation.\u201d The\nlatter term, they contend, evinces Congress\u2019 intent to\nimpose liability only when a party knows its conduct is\nunlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read \u00a71692k(c) to\nencompass \u201call types of error,\u201d including mistakes of law.\nBrief for Respondents 7.\n   We decline to adopt the expansive reading of \u00a71692k(c)\nthat Carlisle proposes. We have long recognized the\n\u201ccommon maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of\nthe law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi\nnally.\u201d Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833)\n(opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see also Cheek v.\nUnited States, 498 U.

In Kolstad v. American\nDental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999), for instance, we ad\ndressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 author\nizing compensatory and punitive damages for \u201cintentional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndifference, as our precedents have made clear for more than 175 years.\nBarlow involved a statute providing for forfeiture of any goods entered\n\u201cby a false denomination\u201d in the office of a customs collector \u201cfor the\nbenefit of drawback or bounty upon the exportation\u201d; the statute\nincluded, however, an exception under which \u201csaid forfeiture shall not\nbe incurred, if it shall be made appear . . . that such false denomination\n. . . happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to\ndefraud the revenue.\u201d 7 Pet., at 406; see also Act of Mar. 2, 1799, \u00a784, 1\nStat. 694. The Court concluded that the shipment at issue, entered as\n\u201crefined sugars,\u201d was mislabeled under the prevailing meaning of that\nterm and thus was subject to forfeiture \u201cunless the [petitioner] c[ould]\nbring himself within the exceptio[n].\u201d 7 Pet., at 409\u2013410. As there had\nbeen no \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cmistake\u201d of fact, the \u201conly mistake, if there ha[d]\nbeen any, [wa]s a mistake of law.\u201d Id., at 410\u2013411. The Court observed\nthat the shipper\u2019s conduct, even if \u201centirely compatible with good faith,\n[wa]s not wholly free from the suspicion of an intention to overreach . . .\nby passing off, as refined sugars, what he well knew were not admitted\nto be such.\u201d Id., at 411. But the Court declined to resolve the case on\nthe ground of the shipper\u2019s intent, instead invoking the \u201ccommon\nmaxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse\nany person, either civilly or criminally.\u201d Ibid. Notwithstanding the\nexistence of a statutory exception\u2014which did not expressly exclude\nlegal errors from the category of \u201cmistake[s]\u201d made without \u201cintention\nto defraud\u201d\u2014the Court saw \u201cnot the least reason to suppose that the\nlegislature, in this enactment, had any intention to supersede the\ncommon principle.\u201d Ibid.\n    The dissent implies Barlow is too old to be relevant. Post, at 16. But\nat least in the context of stare decisis, this Court has suggested prece\ndents tend to gain, not lose, respect with age. See Montejo v. Louisi\nana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13). In any event, Justice\nStory\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court in Barlow is hardly a relic. As\nrecently as 1994 this Court cited it for the \u201cvenerable principle\u201d that\nignorance of the law generally is no defense. Ratzlaf v. United States,\n510 U. S. 135, 149; see also Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199\n(1991) (citing Barlow for a similar proposition).\n\f8              JERMAN v.

We observed that in\nsome circumstances \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d could\noccur without giving rise to punitive damages liability,\nsuch as where an employer is \u201cunaware of the relevant\nfederal prohibition\u201d or acts with the \u201cdistinct belief that its\ndiscrimination is lawful.\u201d 527 U. S., at 536\u2013537. See also\nW. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and\nKeeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed. 1984) (\u201c[I]f one inten\ntionally interferes with the interests of others, he is often\nsubject to liability notwithstanding the invasion was made\nunder an erroneous belief as to some . . . legal matter that\nwould have justified the conduct\u201d); Restatement (Second)\nof Torts \u00a7164, and Comment e (1963\u20131964) (intentional\ntort of trespass can be committed despite the actor\u2019s\nmistaken belief that she has a legal right to enter the\nproperty).6\n   Likely for this reason, when Congress has intended to\nprovide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has\noften done so more explicitly than here. In particular, the\nFTC Act\u2019s administrative-penalty provisions\u2014which, as\nnoted above, Congress expressly incorporated into the\nFDCPA\u2014apply only when a debt collector acts with \u201cac\ntual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\nobjective circumstances\u201d that its action was \u201cprohibited by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Different considerations apply, of course, in interpreting criminal\n\nstatutes. Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 57\u201358, n. 9\n(2007). But even in that context, we have not consistently required\nknowledge that the offending conduct is unlawful. See, e.g., Ellis v.\nUnited States, 206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907) (observing, in the context\nof a statute imposing liability for \u201cintentiona[l] violat[ions],\u201d that \u201c[i]f a\nman intentionally adopts certain conduct in certain circumstances\nknown to him, and that conduct is forbidden by the law under those\ncircumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in\nwhich the law ever considers intent\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Given the\nabsence of similar language in \u00a71692k(c), it is a fair infer\nence that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to\nrecover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory\ndamages for \u201cintentional\u201d conduct, including violations\nresulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA,\nwhile reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act\nfor debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected\n\u201cknowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances\u201d that the conduct was prohibited.

Post, at 4.\nEven if the dissent is correct that the phrase \u201cintentional\nviolation,\u201d standing alone in a civil liability statute, might\nbe read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes\nthe term \u201cnot intentional\u201d \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a71692k(c) with the\nmore specific language of \u00a745(m)(1)(A), which refers to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Indeed,    in International Minerals, the Court faced, and evidently\nrejected, the distinction the dissent would draw today between the term\n\u201c \u2018violation\u2019 \u201d and a reference to \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the violation.\u201d\nPost, at 3. As noted, in International Minerals, the Court rejected a\nmistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who \u201cknow\ningly violat[e]\u201d certain regulations. 402 U.

In so doing,\nhowever, we expressly acknowledged the contrary view adopted by one\nlower court opinion that knowledge of the regulations was necessary.\nId., at 562 (citing St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. v. United States, 220\nF. 2d 393, 397 (CA1 1955) (Magruder, C. J., concurring)). The dissent\ning opinion in International Minerals quoted extensively portions of the\nSt. Johnsbury concurrence that reached its result by contrasting a\nstatute making it an offense \u201c \u2018 \u201cknowingly\u201d to sell adulterated milk\u2019 \u201d\nwith one that makes it an offense \u201c \u2018knowingly [to] violat[e] a regula\ntion.\u2019 \u201d 402 U.

Indeed, the statute in Liparota bears a closer resemblance to\nthe administrative penalty provision in \u00a745(m)(1)(A). See supra, at\n8\u20139.\n\f12         JERMAN v.

The dissent\u2019s reading gives short shrift to that\ntextual distinction.\n   We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona\nfide errors in \u00a71692k(c) do not include mistaken interpre\ntations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt\ncollector maintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to\navoid any such error.\u201d The dictionary defines \u201cprocedure\u201d\nas \u201ca series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1807\n(1976). In that light, the statutory phrase is more natu\nrally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or\nother such \u201cregular orderly\u201d steps to avoid mistakes\u2014for\ninstance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector\nmight adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate\nwith consumers at the wrong time of day, \u00a71692c(a)(1), or\nmake false representations as to the amount of a debt,\n\u00a71692e(2). The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds\nnothing unusual in attorney debt collectors maintaining\nprocedures to avoid legal error. Post, at 18; 538 F. 3d, at\n476. We do not dispute that some entities may maintain\nprocedures to avoid legal errors. But legal reasoning is\nnot a mechanical or strictly linear process. For this rea\nson, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as\namicus curiae supporting Jerman) that the broad statu\ntory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to\navoid \u201cany\u201d bona fide error indicates that the relevant\nprocedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical\nor factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to\navoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, par\nticularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex\nfederal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open\nended prohibitions on, inter alia, \u201cfalse, deceptive,\u201d\n\u00a71692e, or \u201cunfair\u201d practices, \u00a71692f.

See Dada v. Mu\nkasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). As described above, Congress\nincluded in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error de\nfense but also a separate protection from liability for \u201cany\nact done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any\nadvisory opinion of the [FTC].\u201d \u00a71692k(e). In our view,\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 reading is at odds with the role\nCongress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving\nambiguities in the Act. Debt collectors would rarely need\nto consult the FTC if \u00a71692k(c) were read to offer immu\nnity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel.\nIndeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive\nnot to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the\nlaw, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from\nclaiming good-faith immunity for violations and would\npotentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations\nunder the FTC Act.8 More importantly, the existence of a\nseparate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obvi\nously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liabil\nity when the Act\u2019s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs\nagainst stretching the language of the bona fide error\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 One  of Carlisle\u2019s amici suggests the FTC safe harbor would provide\na more categorical immunity than \u00a71692k(c), obviating the need, e.g., to\nmaintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d\nBrief for National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus\nCuriae 18\u201319 (NARCA Brief). Even if that is true, we need not con\nclude that the FTC safe harbor would be rendered entirely superfluous\nto reason that the existence of that provision counsels against extend\ning the bona fide error defense to serve an overlapping function.\n\f14             JERMAN v.

TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several stat\nutes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection\nAct (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in\n1968, \u00a7130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that\nwas in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress\nlater enacted into the FDCPA: \u201cA creditor may not be held\nliable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor\nshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation\nwas not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\nnotwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasona\nbly adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d 82 Stat. 157 (codi\nfied at 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(c)).\n   During the 9-year period between the enactment of\nTILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts\nof Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA\u2019s\nbona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no\nsuch court interpreted TILA to extend to violations result\ning from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.10 We\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Carlisle   raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary\nadministrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt\ncollectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time\nsensitive legal issues that arise in litigation. These practical concerns,\nto which we return below, do not change our understanding of the\nstatutory text itself or the likely intent of the enacting Congress.\n    10 See Ives v. W. T.

Abbott,\n524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998); see also Rowe v. New Hamp\nshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 370 (2008).\nWhile the interpretations of three Federal Courts of Ap\npeals may not have \u201csettled\u201d the meaning of TILA\u2019s bona\nfide error defense, there is no reason to suppose that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1974) (similar).\n   Carlisle contends the meaning of TILA\u2019s defense was unsettled at the\ntime of the FDCPA\u2019s enactment, relying first on several District Court\nopinions extending the defense to good-faith legal errors. See, e.g.,\nWelmaker v. W. T. Grant Co., 365 F. Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972).\nBut even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather\nthan court of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the statu\ntory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on\nthose decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See, e.g., Turner\nv. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 537 F. 2d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) (per\ncuriam) (referring to \u00a71640(c) as the \u201cso-called clerical error defense\u201d).\nCarlisle also relies on the holding in Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc.\nv. Jones, 274 So. 2d 150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana\nSupreme Court concluded only that a lender\u2019s mistaken interpretation\nof state usury law did not \u201camoun[t] to an intentional violation of\n[TILA\u2019s] disclosure requirements.\u201d Id., at 161. The Louisiana court\nhad no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we con\nsider today: whether TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense extended to viola\ntions resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4,\nsupra; see also Starks v. Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 928, 931\n(ED La.) (distinguishing Thrift Funds on this basis), aff\u2019d, 500 F. 2d\n1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents therefore do not convince us that\nCongress would have ascribed a different meaning to the statutory\nlanguage it chose for the FDCPA. Compare post, at 2 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), with Herman &\nMacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 384\u2013386, and n. 21 (1983)\n(concluding that Congress had \u201cratified\u201d the \u201cwell-established judicial\ninterpretation\u201d of a statute by leaving it intact during a comprehensive\nrevision, notwithstanding \u201c[t]wo early district court decisions,\u201d not\nsubsequently followed, that had adopted a contrary view).\n\f16            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCongress disagreed with those interpretations when it\nenacted the FDCPA. Congress copied verbatim the perti\nnent portions of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense into the\nFDCPA. Compare 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(c) (1976 ed.) with\n\u00a7813(c), 91 Stat. 881. This close textual correspondence\nsupports an inference that Congress understood the statu\ntory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Fed\neral Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.11\n   Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance, consistent with\nthe approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a 1980\namendment to TILA that added the following sentence to\nthat statute\u2019s bona fide error defense: \u201cExamples of a bona\nfide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calcula\ntion, computer malfunction and program[m]ing, and print\ning errors, except that an error of legal judgment with\nrespect to a person\u2019s obligations under [TILA] is not a\nbona fide error.\u201d See Truth in Lending Simplification and\nReform Act, \u00a7615, 94 Stat. 181.

Contra, post, at 1\u20132 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nWhether or not we would take that view when such an inference serves\nas a court\u2019s sole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on\ncommon principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the statute\u2019s\ntext and structure. Moreover, the inference is supported by the fact\nthat TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary titles of the\nCCPA, a comprehensive consumer-protection statute.              While not\nnecessary to our conclusion, evidence from the legislative record dem\nonstrates that some Members of Congress understood the relationship\nbetween the FDCPA and existing provisions of the CCPA. See, e.g., 123\nCong. Rec. 10242 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Annunzio) (civil penalty\nprovisions in House version of bill were \u201cconsistent with those in the\n[CCPA]\u201d); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: Hearings on S. 656 et al.\nbefore the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Committee\non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 51, 707\n(1977) (statement of Rep.

For several reasons, we\ndecline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpreta\ntive weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment\nchanged the scope of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense in a\nway material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre\ntations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA\ndefense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Although  again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the\nlegislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the\namendment to \u201cclarif[y]\u201d the meaning of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense\n\u201cto make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,\nprovided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the\nact\u2019s requirements.\u201d S.

Rep. No. 96\u2013368, p. 32 (1979)).\n   The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency\nbetween these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references\nin the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and\nreading the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide error defense to include factual mis\ntakes. Post, at 2\u20134, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,\nhowever, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal\nerrors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.\nSimilarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction\nbetween factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented\nwith claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac\ntual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522\nF. 2d, at 756\u2013757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166\u20131167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,\nat 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti\ntute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are \u201cnot inten\ntional\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71692k(c), we need not and do not decide\ntoday the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or\nwhat kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA\u2019s bona fide\nerror defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,\nFair Debt Collection \u00a77.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case\nlaw on scope of \u00a71692k(c)).\n\f18            JERMAN v.

Congress may\nsimply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta\ntions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions\nwhere courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also\nunclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA\u2019s\ndefense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre\nsents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos\ning liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford\nMotor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)\n(TILA is \u201c \u2018highly technical\u2019 \u201d). Our reluctance to give\ncontrolling weight to the TILA amendment in construing\nthe FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not\nexpressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous\nbona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi\ncally to \u00a71692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,\ne.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a74010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in\nExpedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding \u201can\nerror of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under\nthat Act]\u201d) with 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona\nfide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\nthat are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con\n\nstrued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to\nexclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28\u2013\n30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,\nhas promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense\nin the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.\n\u00a72607(d)(3), does not apply to \u201c[a]n error of legal judgment,\u201d 24 CFR\n\u00a73500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other\nstatutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that\nno agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,\nnothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations\nor the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in\nother statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,\n982\u2013983 (2005).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCarlisle points out that Congress has amended the\nFDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting\nthe scope of \u00a71692k(c), that does not suggest Congress\nviewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car\nlisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a\nCourt of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to\ninclude a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake\nof law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121\u20131124,\nand nn. 14\u201315 (CA10 2002).\n   Carlisle\u2019s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un\navailing. We held in that case that the FDCPA\u2019s defini\ntion of \u201cdebt collector\u201d includes lawyers who regularly,\nthrough litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,\nat 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner\n(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)\nthat our reading would automatically render liable \u201cany\nlitigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim\nagainst a debtor,\u201d on the ground that \u00a71692e(5) prohibits a\ndebt collector from making any \u201c \u2018threat to take action that\ncannot legally be taken.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 295. We expressed skep\nticism that \u00a71692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But\neven assuming the correctness of petitioner\u2019s reading of\n\u00a71692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona\nfide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for\nlitigating lawyers was not \u201cso absurd\u201d as to warrant im\nplying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu\ntory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address\nthe overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis\ncussion of \u00a71692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a\nmisinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall\nunder the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law\nsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be\ncause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.\nLawyers can, of course, invoke \u00a71692k(c) for violations\nresulting from qualifying factual errors.\n   Carlisle\u2019s remaining arguments do not change our view\n\f20          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof \u00a71692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between\nour reading of the term \u201cintentional\u201d in that provision and\nthe instruction in \u00a71692k(b) that a court look to whether\n\u201cnoncompliance was intentional\u201d in assessing statutory\nadditional damages. But assuming \u00a71692k(b) encom\npasses errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in\nreading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory dam\nages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where\na debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection\nof the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned\nthat under our reading, \u00a71692k(c) would be unavailable to\na debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA\napplying to acts taken with particular intent because in\nsuch instances the relevant act would not be uninten\ntional. See, e.g., \u00a71692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector\nfrom \u201c[c]ausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with\nintent to annoy, abuse, or harass\u201d). Including mistakes as\nto the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would\nensure that \u00a71692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We\nsee no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense\nmust cover every provision of the Act.\n   The parties and amici make arguments concerning the\nlegislative history that we address for the sake of com\npleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Com\nmittee Report stating that \u201c[a] debt collector has no liabil\nity . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with\nregard to the act\u2019s coverage, when such violation is unin\ntentional and occurred despite procedures designed to\navoid such violations.\u201d S. Rep. No. 95\u2013382, p. 5 (1977); see\nalso post, at 4\u20136 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (discussing report).\nBut by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unam\nbiguously support Carlisle\u2019s reading. Even if a bona fide\nmistake \u201cwith regard to the act\u2019s coverage\u201d could be read\nin isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading\ndoes not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake \u201cwith regard\nto the act\u2019s coverage\u201d may derive wholly from a debt collec\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

There is no reason to\nread this passing statement in the Senate Report as con\ntemplating an exemption for legal error that is the product\nof an attorney\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA\u2014\nparticularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d until 1986. 100 Stat. 768.\nMoreover, the reference to \u201cany manner\u201d of violation is\nexpressly qualified by the requirements that the violation\nbe \u201cunintentional\u201d and occur despite maintenance of ap\npropriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose\nbetween these possible readings of the Senate Report, as\nthe legislative record taken as a whole does not lend\nstrong support to Carlisle\u2019s view.14 We therefore decline to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 For instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the\nSenate Banking Committee\u2019s consideration of the FDCPA that would\nhave required proof that a debt collector\u2019s violation was \u201cknowin[g].\u201d\nSenator Riegle, one of the Act\u2019s primary sponsors, opposed the change,\nexplaining that the bill reflected the view that \u201ccertain things ought not\nto happen, period. . . . [W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully,\nyou know, with a good heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.\u201d See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup\nSession: S. 1130\u2014Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (here\ninafter Markup); see also ibid. (\u201cWe have left a way for these disputes\nto be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody can say, I\ndidn\u2019t know that, or my computer malfunctioned, something happened,\nI didn\u2019t intend for the effect to be as it was\u201d). To similar effect, a House\nReport on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new\nlegislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds\nthat existing statutes \u201cfrequently require[d]\u201d a showing of \u201cspecific\nintent[,] which is difficult to prove.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013131, p. 3 (1977).\nElsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more\nsupportive of Carlisle\u2019s interpretation. In particular, a concern was\nraised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error\ndefense had been interpreted \u201cas only protecting against a mathemati\ncal error,\u201d and that the FDCPA defense should \u201cgo beyond\u201d TILA to\n\u201callow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a\ntechnical error.\u201d Markup 20. In response, a staffer explained that the\n\f22            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngive controlling weight to this isolated passage.\n                              B\n   Carlisle, its amici, and the dissent raise the additional\nconcern that our reading will have unworkable practical\nconsequences for debt collecting lawyers. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Respondents 40\u201341, 45\u201348; NARCA Brief 4\u201316; post, at\n5\u201314. Carlisle claims the FDCPA\u2019s private enforcement\nprovisions have fostered a \u201ccottage industry\u201d of profes\nsional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial viola\ntions of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40\u201341. If debt\ncollecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their\nreasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the\nAct, Carlisle and its amici foresee a flood of lawsuits\nagainst creditors\u2019 lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attor\nneys) seeking damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The threat of\nsuch liability, in the dissent\u2019s view, creates an irreconcil\nable conflict between an attorney\u2019s personal financial\ninterest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on\nbehalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the\nFDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,\nexposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving\nthe legal ambiguity against her client\u2019s interest or advis\ning the client to settle\u2014even where there is substantial\nlegal authority for a position favoring the client. Post, at\n10\u201314.15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFDCPA defense would \u201capply to any violation of the act which was\nunintentional,\u201d and answered affirmatively when the Chairman asked:\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not simply a mathematical error but any bona fide error without\nintent?\u201d Id., at 21. Whatever the precise balance of these statements\nmay be, we can conclude that this equivocal evidence from legislative\nhistory does not displace the clear textual and contextual authority\ndiscussed above.\n  15 The dissent also cites several other consumer-protection statutes,\n\nsuch as TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681 et\nseq., which in its view create \u201cincentives to file lawsuits even where no\nactual harm has occurred\u201d and are illustrative of what the dissent\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not believe our holding today portends such grave\nconsequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro\nvisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,\nthereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors\u2019 attor\nneys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the \u201cactual\ndamage[s]\u201d sustained, \u00a71692k(a)(1), will likely be de\nminimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on \u201cadditional\u201d\ndamages, \u00a71692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to\nadjust such damages where a violation is based on a good\nfaith error, \u00a71692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor\nney\u2019s fees may shape financial incentives even where\nactual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief\n11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and \u201ca\nreasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court\u201d in\nthe case of \u201cany successful action to enforce the foregoing\nliability.\u201d \u00a71692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under this statute,16\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nperceives to be a \u201ctroubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the\nsystem to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into\nlucrative litigation.\u201d Post, at 5\u20136. The dissent\u2019s concern is primarily\nwith Congress\u2019 policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize\nprivate rights of action and recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and in\nsome cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the\nstatutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a\nmistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the \u201chighly technical\u201d nature of\nthe scheme. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.\nMilhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the\nFDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only \u201cactual dam\nage[s]\u201d for harm suffered but also \u201csuch additional damages as the\ncourt may allow,\u201d \u00a71692k(a).\n   16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court\u2019s calcula\n\ntion of an attorney fee award under \u00a71692k for abuse of discretion. See,\ne.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628\u2013629 (CA4 1995);\nEmanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).\nMany District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward\nadjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law\nOffices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)\n(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.\nConrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148\u20131151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)\n\f24            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand \u00a71692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney\u2019s\nfees to the defendant if a plaintiff\u2019s suit \u201cwas brought in\nbad faith and for the purpose of harassment.\u201d\n   Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in\n\u00a71692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation\nstems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act\nitself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for\ninstance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac\ntual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that\nlawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the\nAct by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under\n\u00a71692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not\nfrequently issued such opinions, and that the average\nprocessing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,\nthe Government informed us at oral argument that the\nFTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in\nresponse to seven requests), and the FTC\u2019s response time\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection \u00a76.8.6. In\nSchlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for\nthe \u201cunnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,\nshort-lived [FDCPA] case.\u201d 574 F. 3d, at 854\u2013855. In Carroll, the court\nfound no abuse of discretion in a District Court\u2019s award of a $500\nattorney\u2019s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had\nrecovered only $50 in damages for \u201cat most a technical violation\u201d of the\nFDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629\u2013631.\n  Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,\n\u00a71692k requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Compare Tolentino v.\nFriedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful\nplaintiff \u201cmandatory\u201d), and Emanuel, supra, at 808\u2013809 (same, even\nwhere the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.\n2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney\u2019s fees may be denied for plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbad\nfaith conduct\u201d), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150\u2013152 (CA5\n1996) (\u201cattorney\u2019s fees . . . are only available [under \u00a71692k] where the\nplaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for\nactual and/or additional damages\u201d; this reading \u201cwill deter suits\nbrought only as a means of generating attorney\u2019s fees\u201d). We need not\nresolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading\nof \u00a71692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting\nlawyers.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Without disregarding the possibility that the\nFTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some\ncases, evidence of present administrative practice makes\nus reluctant to place significant weight on \u00a71692k(e) as a\npractical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.\n   We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise\nof Carlisle\u2019s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is\na debt collector\u2019s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.\nWe addressed a similar argument in Heintz, in which the\npetitioner urged that certain of the Act\u2019s substantive\nprovisions would generate \u201c \u2018anomalies\u2019 \u201d if the term \u201cdebt\ncollector\u201d was read to include litigating lawyers. 514\nU. S., at 295. Among other things, the petitioner in Heintz\ncontended that \u00a71692c(c)\u2019s bar on further communication\nwith a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is\nrefusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from\nfiling a lawsuit to collect the debt. Id., at 296\u2013297. We\nagreed it would be \u201codd\u201d if the Act interfered in this way\nwith \u201can ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit\u201d but suggested\n\u00a71692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several\nexceptions in the text of that provision itself. Ibid. As in\nHeintz, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act\u2019s\nconduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provi\nsions should not be assumed to compel absurd results\nwhen applied to debt collecting attorneys.\n   To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a\nlawyer\u2019s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique\nin our law. \u201c[A]n attorney\u2019s ethical duty to advance the\ninterests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty\nto comply with the law and standards of professional\nconduct.\u201d Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\nLawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits\npresented \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass,\ncause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\nlitigation.\u201d Fed.

In\nsome circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability\nfor conduct undertaken during representation of a client.\nSee, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate\nBank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191 (1994) (\u201cAny\nperson or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a\nmanipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or\nomission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities\nrelies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities\nand Exchange Commission Rule] 10b\u20135\u201d).\n   Moreover, a lawyer\u2019s interest in avoiding FDCPA liabil\nity may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts\nhave held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers\u2019 viola\ntions of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Fox v. Citicorp Credit\nServs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also First\nInterstate Bank of Fort Collins, N. A. v. Soucie, 924 P. 2d\n1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).\n   The suggestion that our reading of \u00a71692k(c) will create\nunworkable consequences is also undermined by the exis\ntence of numerous state consumer protection and debt\ncollection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses\nthat are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal\nerrors.17 Several States have enacted debt collection\nstatutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney\ndebt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all.

Neither\nCarlisle and its amici nor the dissent demonstrate that\nlawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these\nstate regimes.\n  In the dissent\u2019s view, these policy concerns are evidence\nthat \u201cCongress could not have intended\u201d the reading we\nadopt today. Post, at 5. But the dissent\u2019s reading raises\nconcerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of\nthis case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dis\nsent\u2019s view, \u201cacted reasonably at every step\u201d and commit\nted a \u201ctechnical violation\u201d resulting in no \u201cactual harm\u201d to\nthe debtor. Post, at 12, 6, 8. But the dissent\u2019s legal theory\ndoes not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or\n\u201ctechnical\u201d violations.19 Under that approach, it appears,\nnonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity\nfor mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by\nseeking the advice of legal counsel. Moreover, many debt\ncollectors are compensated with a percentage of money\nrecovered, and so will have a financial incentive to press\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a716a\u20135\u2013201(7) (2007) (provision of Kansas\nConsumer Credit Code providing a defense for a \u201cbona fide error of law\nor fact\u201d); Ind. Code \u00a724\u20139\u20135\u20135 (West 2004) (defense for creditor\u2019s \u201cbona\nfide error of law or fact\u201d in Indiana Home Loan Practices Act).\n   19 The dissent also downplays the predicate fact that respondents in\n\nthis case brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Jerman for a debt she\nhad already repaid. Neither the lower courts nor this Court have been\nasked to consider, and thus we express no view about, whether Carlisle\ncould be subject to liability under the FDCPA for that uncontested\nerror\u2014regardless of how reasonably Carlisle may have acted after the\nmistake was pointed out by Jerman\u2019s (privately retained) lawyer.\n\f28            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe boundaries of the Act\u2019s prohibitions on collection tech\nniques. It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collec\ntors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of\nthe law would be consistent with the statute\u2019s broadly\nworded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct. Jerman\nand her amici express further concern that the dissent\u2019s\nreading would give a competitive advantage to debt collec\ntors who press the boundaries of lawful conduct. They\nforesee a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d driving ethical collectors out\nof business. Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for Public Citi\nzen et al. as Amici Curiae 16\u201318. It is difficult to square\nsuch a result with Congress\u2019 express purpose \u201cto eliminate\nabusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, [and]\nto insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using\nabusive debt collection practices are not competitively\ndisadvantaged,\u201d \u00a71692(e).\n  The dissent\u2019s reading also invites litigation about a debt\ncollector\u2019s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and the\nadequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error.\nCf. Barlow, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the\nlaw will not excuse civil or criminal liability \u201cresults from\nthe extreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide,\nthe interpretation of the party\u201d).         Courts that read\n\u00a71692k(c) to permit a mistake-of-law defense have adopted\nvarying formulations of what legal procedures are \u201crea\nsonably adapted to avoid any [legal] error.\u201d20 Among other\nuncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 Compare Hartman v. Great Senaca Financial Corp., 569 F. 3d 606,\n\n614\u2013615 (CA6 2009) (suggesting that reasonable procedures might\ninclude \u201cperform[ing] ongoing FDCPA training, procur[ing] the most\nrecent case law, or hav[ing] an individual responsible for continuing\ncompliance with the FDCPA\u201d), with Johnson v. Riddle, 443 F. 3d 723,\n730\u2013731 (CA10 2006) (suggesting that researching case law and filing a\ntest case might be sufficient, but remanding for a jury determination of\nwhether the \u201climited [legal] analysis\u201d undertaken was sufficient and\nwhether the test case was in fact a \u201csham\u201d).\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

The increased\ncost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty\nof outcome may chill private suits under the statutory\nright of action, undermining the FDCPA\u2019s calibrated\nscheme of statutory incentives to encourage self\nenforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The\nChallenge of Change 67 (2009) (\u201cBecause the Commission\nreceives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection\ncomplaints per year, it is not feasible for federal govern\nment law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary\nmeans of deterring all possible law violations\u201d). The state\namici predict that, on the dissent\u2019s reading, consumers\nwill have little incentive to bring enforcement actions\n\u201cwhere the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such cir\ncumstances a debt collector could easily claim bona fide\nerror of law\u201d; in the States\u2019 view, the resulting \u201cenforce\nment gap\u201d would be \u201cextensive\u201d at both the federal and\nState levels. See Brief for State of New York et al. as\nAmici Curiae 7\u201310. In short, the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent tell only half the story.21\n  In sum, we do not foresee that our decision today will\nplace unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the\ndebt collection industry. To the extent debt collecting\nlawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the\nrequirements of the FDCPA, Carlisle, its amici, and the\ndissent have not shown that \u201cthe result [will be] so absurd\nas to warrant\u201d disregarding the weight of textual author\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 The dissent adds in passing that today\u2019s decision \u201ccreates serious\n\nconcerns . . . for First Amendment rights.\u201d Post, at 13 (citing Legal\nServices Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 545 (2001)). That\nclaim was neither raised nor passed upon below, and was mentioned\nneither in the certiorari papers nor the parties\u2019 merits briefing to this\nCourt. We decline to express any view on it. See Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n\f30            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nity discussed above. Heintz, 514 U. S., at 295. Absent\nsuch a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an unde\nsirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpre\ntation are properly addressed to Congress. To the extent\nCongress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA\u2019s\nliability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute\naccordingly.22 Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to\nrevise \u00a71692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or\ngrant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a\nplaintiff\u2019s recovery. This Court may not, however, read\nmore into \u00a71692k(c) than the statutory language naturally\nsupports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error de\nfense in \u00a71692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the\nFDCPA resulting from a debt collector\u2019s incorrect interpre\ntation of the requirements of that statute.\n                        *     *  *\n  For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 The FDCPA has been amended some eight times since its enact\n\nment in 1977; the most recent amendment addressed a concern not\nunrelated to the question we consider today, specifying that a pleading\nin a civil action is not an \u201cinitial communication\u201d triggering obligations\nunder \u00a71692g requiring a written notice to the consumer.

See Brief for Respondents\n44\u201348; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995). Can those\nlawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face\npersonal liability when they rely on good-faith interpreta\ntions of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will\nthat threat of personal liability lead them to do less than\ntheir best for those clients?\n   As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a\nway out of\u2014though not a panacea for\u2014this dilemma.\nAnte, at 13\u201314, 24\u201325. Faced with legal uncertainty, a\nlawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or\nCommission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR \u00a7\u00a71.1 to 1.4\n(2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it\nthe dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion,\nhe has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable.\nIf he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any\nsuch liability. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(e) (debt collectors im\nmune from liability for \u201cany act done or omitted in . . .\nconformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal\nTrade] Commission\u201d). See also R. Hobbs et al., National\nConsumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection \u00a7\u00a76.12.2, 7.3\n\f2          JERMAN v.

Appar\nently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only\nseven requests and issued four opinions.

A portion of the Court\u2019s reasoning consists\nof this: The language in the Fair Debt Collection Practices\nAct (FDCPA or Act) tracks language in the Truth in Lend\ning Act (TILA); and in the nine years between the enact\nment of TILA and the enactment of the FDCPA, three\nCourts of Appeals had \u201cinterpreted TILA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense as referring to clerical errors.\u201d Ante, at 14. Rely\ning on our statement in Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624,\n645 (1998), that Congress\u2019s repetition, in a new statute, of\nstatutory language with a \u201c \u2018settled\u2019 \u201d judicial interpreta\ntion indicates \u201c \u2018the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial\ninterpretations as well,\u2019 \u201d the Court concludes that these\nthree Court of Appeals cases \u201csuppor[t] an inference that\nCongress understood the statutory formula it chose for the\nFDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpre\ntations of TILA.\u201d Ante, at 14\u201316.\n   Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what\ncounts is what Congress \u201cintended,\u201d even if that intent\nfinds no expression in the enacted text. When a large\nmajority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time,\nhave uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the\nmeaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reason\n\f2            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                  KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nable to assume that Congress was aware of those holdings,\ntook them to be correct, and intended the same meaning in\nadopting that text.1 It seems to me unreasonable, how\never, to assume that, when Congress has a bill before it\nthat contains language used in an earlier statute, it is\naware of, and approves as correct, a mere three Court of\nAppeals decisions interpreting that earlier statute over\nthe previous nine years. Can one really believe that a\nmajority in both Houses of Congress knew of those three\ncases, and accepted them as correct (even when, as was\nthe case here, some District Court opinions and a State\nSupreme Court opinion had concluded, to the contrary,\nthat the defense covered legal errors, see ante, at 14\u201315,\nn. 10)? This is a legal fiction, which has nothing to be said\nfor it except that it can sometimes make our job easier.\nThe Court acknowledges that \u201cthe interpretations of three\nFederal Courts of Appeals may not have \u2018settled\u2019 the\nmeaning of TILA\u2019s bona fide error defense,\u201d but says\n\u201cthere is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed\nwith those interpretations.\u201d Ante, at 15\u201316. Perhaps not;\nbut no reason to suppose that it knew of and agreed with\nthem either\u2014which is presumably the proposition for\nwhich the Court cites them.\n   Even assuming, moreover, that Congress knew and\napproved of those cases, they would not support the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion today. All three of them said that\nTILA\u2019s bona fide error defense covered only clerical errors.\nSee Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975)\n(\u201conly available for clerical errors\u201d); Haynes v. Logan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Of course where so many federal courts have read the language that\n\nway, the text was probably clear enough that resort to unexpressed\ncongressional intent would be unnecessary. Or indeed it could be said\nthat such uniform and longstanding judicial interpretation had estab\nlished the public meaning of the text, whether the Members of Con\ngress were aware of the cases or not. That would be the understanding\nof the text by reasonable people familiar with its legal context.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Wilson, 502\nF. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (\u201c[C]lerical errors . . . are the\nonly violations this section was designed to excuse\u201d). Yet\nthe Court specifically interprets the identical language in\nthe FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical\nerrors, but also for factual errors. See ante, at 19, 24; see\nalso ante, at 20\u201321 (suggesting the same). If the Court\nreally finds the three Courts of Appeals\u2019 interpretations of\nTILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it\nshould restrict its decision accordingly. As for me, I sup\nport the Court\u2019s inclusion of factual errors, because there\nis nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable\n\u201cnot intentional\u201d violations to those based on clerical\nerrors, and since there is a long tradition in the common\nlaw and in our construction of federal statutes distinguish\ning errors of fact from errors of law.\n   The Court\u2019s opinion also makes fulsome use of that\nother legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a\nsingle Representative\u2019s floor remarks on the House bill\nthat became the FDCPA, ante, at 16, n. 11, to a single\nRepresentative\u2019s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee\nhearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, ibid., to\ntwo 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the\nFDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, ante, at\n17, n. 12, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Sen\nate bill on the FDCPA, ante, at 21\u201322, n. 14, to a House\nReport dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, ibid.\nIs the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out\nsuch mini-nuggets of \u201ccongressional intent\u201d from floor\nremarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and\ncommittee reports covering many different bills over many\nyears? When the Court addresses such far-afield legisla\ntive history merely \u201cfor the sake of completeness,\u201d ante, at\n20, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful\nover-lawyering.\n\f4            JERMAN v.

Likewise, the 1999\nAmerican Law Report the Court cites, ante, at 17, n. 12,\nwhich relies on another Senate Committee Report, de\nscribes the amendment as clarifying the \u201cprevailing view\u201d\nthat the defense \u201capplies to clerical errors,\u201d Lockhart, 153\nA. L. R. Fed. 211\u2013212, \u00a72[a] (1999).2 Once again, the legal\nfiction contradicts the Court\u2019s conclusion that the lan\nguage in the FDCPA, identical to the original TILA de\nfense, applies to mistakes of fact.\n   But if legislative history is to be used, it should be used\nimpartially. (Legislative history, after all, almost always\nhas something for everyone!) The Court dismisses with a\nwave of the hand what seems to me the most persuasive\nlegislative history (if legislative history could ever be\npersuasive) in the case. The respondents point to the\nSenate Committee Report on the FDCPA, which says that\n\u201c[a] debt collector has no liability . . . if he violates the act\nin any manner, including with regard to the act\u2019s coverage,\nwhen such violation is unintentional and occurred despite\nprocedures designed to avoid such violations.\u201d S. Rep. No.\n95\u2013382, p. 5 (1977) (emphasis added). The Court claims\nthat a mistake about \u201cthe act\u2019s coverage\u201d in this passage\nmight refer to factual mistakes, such as a debt collector\u2019s\nmistaken belief \u201cthat a particular debt arose out of a\nnonconsumer transaction and was therefore not \u2018covered\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The page cited in the Senate Committee Report does not actually\n\nsupport the American Law Report\u2019s statement.

The Court\u2019s explanation seems to\nme inadequate. No lawyer\u2014indeed, no one speaking\naccurately\u2014would equate a mistake regarding the Act\u2019s\ncoverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular\nfact situation falls within the Act\u2019s coverage. What the\nAct covers (\u201cthe act\u2019s coverage\u201d) is one thing; whether a\nparticular case falls within the Act\u2019s coverage is something\nelse.\n   Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase could be\nused to refer to both these things, by what principle does\nthe Court reject the more plausible meaning? The fact\nthat \u201cattorneys were excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of\n\u2018debt collector\u2019 until 1986,\u201d ibid., does not, as the Court\ncontends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not\ncovered. Attorneys are not the only ones who would have\nbeen able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys\nmake legal mistakes too. They also sometimes receive and\nrely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys. Indeed,\nif anyone could satisfy the defense\u2019s requirement of main\ntaining \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid\u201d a legal\nerror, it would be a non-attorney debt collector who fol\nlows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his\nattorney.\n   The Court also points to \u201cequivocal\u201d evidence from the\nSenate Committee\u2019s final markup session, ante, at 21\u201322,\nn. 14, but it minimizes a decidedly unhelpful discussion of\nthe scope of the defense during the session. In response to\nconcern that the defense would be construed, like the\nTILA defense, as \u201conly protecting against a mathematical\nerror,\u201d a staff member explained that, because of differ\nences in the nature of the statutes, the FDCPA defense\nwas broader than the TILA defense and \u201cwould apply to\nany violation of the act which was unintentional.\u201d See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Af\nfairs, Markup Session: S. 1130\u2014Debt Collection Legisla\ntion 20\u201321 (July 26, 1977) (emphasis added).

The repeated use of \u201cany\u201d\u2014\u201cany\nviolation\u201d and \u201cany bona fide error\u201d\u2014supports the natural\nreading of the Committee Report\u2019s statement regarding\n\u201cthe act\u2019s coverage\u201d as including legal errors about the\nscope of the Act, rather than just factual errors.\n  The Court ultimately dismisses the Senate Committee\nReport on the ground that \u201cthe legislative record taken as\na whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle\u2019s view.\u201d\nAnte, at 21. I think it more reasonable to give zero weight\nto the other snippets of legislative history that the Court\nrelies upon, for the reason that the Senate Committee\nReport on the very bill that became the FDCPA flatly\ncontradicts them. It is almost invariably the case that our\nopinions benefit not at all from the make-weight use of\nlegislative history. But today\u2019s opinion probably suffers\nfrom it. Better to spare us the results of legislative-history\nresearch, however painfully and exhaustively conducted it\nmight have been.\n  The Court\u2019s textual analysis stands on its own, without\nneed of (or indeed any assistance from) the two fictions I\nhave discussed. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of\nthe Court.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. C. \u00a71692 et seq. The\nstatute excepts from liability a debt collector\u2019s \u201cbona fide\nerror[s],\u201d provided that they were \u201cnot intentional\u201d and\nreasonable procedures have been maintained to avoid\nthem. \u00a71692k(c). The Court today interprets this excep\ntion to exclude legal errors. In doing so, it adopts a ques\ntionable interpretation and rejects a straightforward,\nquite reasonable interpretation of the statute\u2019s plain\nterms. Its decision aligns the judicial system with those\nwho would use litigation to enrich themselves at the ex\npense of attorneys who strictly follow and adhere to pro\nfessional and ethical standards.\n   When the law is used to punish good-faith mistakes;\nwhen adopting reasonable safeguards is not enough to\navoid liability; when the costs of discovery and litigation\nare used to force settlement even absent fault or injury;\nwhen class-action suits transform technical legal viola\ntions into windfalls for plaintiffs or their attorneys, the\nCourt, by failing to adopt a reasonable interpretation to\ncounter these excesses, risks compromising its own insti\ntutional responsibility to ensure a workable and just\nlitigation system.

See ante, at 1\u20132.\nThe statute permits private suits against debt collectors\nwho violate its provisions. \u00a71692k(a). An exception\nto liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error\ndefense:\n    \u201cA debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    . . . if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of\n    evidence that the violation was not intentional and\n    resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n    maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to\n    avoid any such error.\u201d \u00a71692k(c).\nThis language does not exclude mistakes of law and is\nmost naturally read to include them. Certainly a mis\ntaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a \u201cbona\nfide error\u201d as that phrase is normally understood. See\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cerror\u201d\nas \u201ca belief that what is false is true or that what is true is\nfalse,\u201d def. 1); ibid. (\u201c[a] mistake of law or of fact in a\ntribunal\u2019s judgment, opinion, or order,\u201d def. 2); ibid. (list\ning categories of legal errors).\n   The choice of words provides further reinforcement for\nthis view. The bona fide error exception in \u00a71692k(c)\napplies if \u201cthe violation was not intentional and resulted\nfrom a bona fide error.\u201d The term \u201cviolation\u201d specifically\ndenotes a legal infraction. See id., at 1600 (\u201cAn infraction\nor breach of the law; a transgression,\u201d def. 1). The statu\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

By\nlinking the mens rea requirement (\u201cnot intentional\u201d) with\nthe word \u201cviolation\u201d\u2014rather than with the conduct giving\nrise to the violation\u2014the Act by its terms indicates that\nthe bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well\nas to factual ones.\n   The Court\u2019s precedents accord with this interpretation.\nFederal statutes that link the term \u201cviolation\u201d with a mens\nrea requirement have been interpreted to excuse good\nfaith legal mistakes. See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland\nShoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase \u201caris\ning out of a willful violation\u201d in the Fair Labor Standards\nAct applies where an employer \u201ceither knew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the statute\u201d); Trans World Airlines, Inc.\nv. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125, 126 (1985) (damages\nprovision under the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, which applies \u201conly in cases of willful violations,\u201d\ncreates liability where an employer \u201cknew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the ADEA\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); cf. Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 428\n(1985) (prohibition on use of food stamps \u201c \u2018knowing [them]\nto have been received . . . in violation of\u2019 \u201d federal law\n\u201cundeniably requires a knowledge of illegality\u201d (emphasis\ndeleted)). The FDCPA\u2019s use of \u201cviolation\u201d thus distin\nguishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the\nCourt to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are\ndisfavored. See, e.g., ante, at 7\u20138 (citing Kolstad v. Ameri\ncan Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999)).\n\f4          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\n   The Court\u2019s response is that there is something distinc\ntive about the word \u201cwillful\u201d that suggests an excuse for\nmistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal stat\nutes, in which the terms \u201c \u2018knowing,\u2019 \u2018intentional\u2019 [and]\n\u2018willful\u2019 \u201d have been distinguished in this regard. Ante, at\n10 (citing Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47,\n57 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal\ncontext:\n    \u201cIt is different in the criminal law. When the term\n    \u2018willful\u2019 or \u2018willfully\u2019 has been used in a criminal stat\n    ute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting\n    liability to knowing violations. This reading of the\n    term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where\n    it is characteristically used to require a criminal in\n    tent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt,\n    or an additional \u2018bad purpose,\u2019 or specific intent to vio\n    late a known legal duty created by highly technical\n    statutes.\u201d Id., at 57\u201358, n. 9 (citations omitted).\nFor this reason, the Court\u2019s citation to criminal cases,\nwhich are themselves inconsistent, see Ratzlaf v. United\nStates, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), is unavailing. See ante, at\n10\u201311, and n. 7.\n  In the civil context, by contrast, the word \u201cwillful\u201d has\nbeen used to impose a mens rea threshold for liability that\nis lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.\nSee Safeco, supra, at 57 (\u201c[W]here willfulness is a statu\ntory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it\nto cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but\nreckless ones as well\u201d). Avoiding liability under a statute\naimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier,\nnot harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed\nat willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in\nThurston or McLaughlin\u2014both civil cases\u2014suggesting\nthat they would have come out differently had the rele\nvant statutes used \u201cintentional violation\u201d rather than\n\f                   Cite as: 559 U.

Even if\nthis were merely a permissible reading, however, it should\nbe adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must\nflow from the Court\u2019s contrary decision. The Court\u2019s read\ning leads to results Congress could not have intended.\n                              1\n   The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Con\ngress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of\nthese statutes authorize the filing of private suits against\nthose who use unfair or improper practices. See, e.g., 15\nU. S. C. \u00a71692k (FDCPA); \u00a71640 (Truth in Lending Act);\n\u00a71681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S. C. \u00a732710\n(Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S. C. \u00a7526(c)(2)\n(Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a success\nful plaintiff to recover\u2014in addition to actual damages\u2014\nstatutory damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and in some\ncases punitive damages. E.g., 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(a)(2)\n(statutory damages); \u00a71640(a)(3) (attorney\u2019s fees and\ncosts); \u00a71681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages);\n\u00a71681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees); 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a732710(a) (\u201c3 times the actual damages or $1,500, which\never is greater\u201d); \u00a732710(b) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees); 11\nU. S. C. \u00a7526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney\u2019s fees). Some\nalso explicitly permit class-action suits. E.g., 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71640(a)(2)(B); \u00a71692k(a)(2)(B).\n   A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create\nincentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has\noccurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover\nstatutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney\nwill receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how\nslight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not\n\f6           JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nnecessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as\nhappy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who\nwill receive fees regardless). The defendant, meanwhile,\nmay conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs\nof discovery and a protracted trial. And if the suit attains\nclass-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to \u201cthe\nlesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the\n[defendant]\u201d); \u00a71692k(a)(2)(B) (same).\n   The present case offers an object lesson. Respondents\nfiled a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that\nmistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it. Jerman\u2019s\nattorney then informed respondents that the debt had\nbeen paid in full. Respondents confirmed this fact with\nthe client and withdrew the lawsuit.\n   This might have been the end of the story. But because\nrespondents had informed Jerman that she was required\nto dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action\ncomplaint. It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no\nharm as a result of respondents\u2019 actions. Jerman sued for\ndamages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs\u2014including class dam\nages of \u201c$500,000 or 1% of defendants\u2019 net worth which\never is less.\u201d Amended Complaint in No. 1:06\u2013CV\u201301397\n(ND Ohio), p. 4. In addition to merits-related discovery,\nJerman sought information from respondents concerning\nthe income and net worth of each partner in the firm. At\nsome point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents\nfor $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney\u2019s fees.\nAmended Joint App. in No. 07\u20133964 (CA6), pp. 256\u2013262.\nThe case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex\nfederal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incen\ntives to settle simply to avoid attorney\u2019s fees.\n   Today\u2019s holding gives new impetus to this already trou\nbling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to\nspin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law\ninto lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nattorneys who conceive of the suit. See Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corp. v. Lamar, 503 F. 3d 504, 513 (CA6\n2007) (referring to the \u201ccottage industry\u201d of litigation that\nhas arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by\nthis dynamic. That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide\nerror defense. The Court\u2019s ruling, however, endorses and\ndrives forward this dynamic, for today\u2019s holding leaves\nattorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for\nadopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be\nmistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid\nmistakes.\n   The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting\nthat trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of\nactual damages and that trial courts \u201chave discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under [the] statute.\u201d\nAnte, at 23. It is not clear, however, that a court is per\nmitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of\nthe suit\u2019s utility. Cf. Perdue v. Kenny A., post, at 9 (noting\na \u201c \u2018strong presumption\u2019 \u201d of reasonableness that attaches\nto a lodestar calculation of attorney\u2019s fees). Though the\nCourt, properly, does not address the question here, it\nacknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to\nvictorious plaintiffs to be \u201c \u2018mandatory,\u2019 \u201d even if the plain\ntiff suffered no damage. Ante, at 23\u201324, n. 16.\n   The Court\u2019s second response is that the FDCPA guards\nagainst abusive suits and that suits brought \u201c \u2018in bad faith\nand for the purpose of harassment\u2019 \u201d can lead to a fee\naward for the defendant.            Ante, at 24 (quoting\n\u00a71692k(a)(3)). Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits\nbased on technical\u2014but harmless\u2014violations of the stat\nute. If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a\nsettlement, then by definition the suit will not have been\nbrought in bad faith. See Emanuel v. American Credit\nExch., 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant\u2019s\n\u201cclaim for malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the\n\f8          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\naction subject of the claim is unsuccessful\u201d).\n   Again the present case is instructive. Jerman brought\nsuit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted\nfrom respondents\u2019 actions. At the time her complaint was\nfiled, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether\na debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in\nwriting, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached\ndifferent answers. Ante, at 4, n. 2. The trial court in this\ncase happened to side with Jerman on the issue, 464\nF. Supp. 2d 720, 722\u2013725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems\nunlikely that the court would have labeled her suit \u201cabu\nsive\u201d or \u201cin bad faith\u201d even if it had gone the other way.\n   There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one\ncontemplates the practical consequences of today\u2019s deci\nsion. Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16\nCFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPA regulations), technical viola\ntions are likely to be common. Indeed, the Court acknowl\nedges that they are inevitable. See ante, at 12. As long as\nlegal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will\nhave an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It\nseems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system\nthat encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over\nharmless violations committed in good faith despite rea\nsonable safeguards.\n   When construing a federal statute, courts should be\nmindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional\npurposes explicit in the statutory text. The FDCPA states\nan objective that today\u2019s decision frustrates. The statu\ntory purpose was to \u201celiminate abusive debt collection\npractices\u201d and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain\nfrom using those practices \u201care not competitively disad\nvantaged.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692(e) (\u201cPurposes\u201d). The prac\ntices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is\ndeliberate, see \u00a71692(a) (\u201cabusive, deceptive, and unfair\ndebt collection practices\u201d); \u00a71692(c) (\u201cmisrepresentation or\nother abusive debt collection practices\u201d), or unreasonable,\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsee \u00a71692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from commu\nnicating with debtors at times \u201cwhich should be known\u201d to\nbe inconvenient); \u00a71692e(8) (prohibiting the communica\ntion of credit card information \u201cwhich should be known to\nbe false\u201d). That explains the statutory objective not to\ndisadvantage debt collectors who \u201crefrain\u201d from abusive\npractices\u2014that is to say, debt collectors who do not inten\ntionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains\nwhy Congress included a good-faith error exception,\nwhich exempts violations that are not intentional or\nunreasonable.\n   In referring to \u201cabusive debt collection practices,\u201d how\never, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who\nact based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal\ninterpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competi\ntive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more\nthan by making good-faith factual errors. This is ex\npressly so if the debt collector has implemented \u201cproce\ndures reasonably adapted to avoid\u201d them. By reading\n\u00a71692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court\nfails to align its interpretation with the statutory\nobjectives.\n   The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy\nconcerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt\ncollectors who \u201cpress the boundaries of the Act\u2019s prohibi\ntions\u201d and about a potential \u201c \u2018race to the bottom.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 27\u201328 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in\nits view, interpreting \u00a71692k(c) to encompass legal mis\ntakes might mean that \u201cnonlawyer debt collectors could\nobtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of\nthe FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.\u201d\nAnte, at 27. It must be remembered, however, that\n\u00a71692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector\u2019s\nerror is \u201cbona fide\u201d and where \u201creasonable procedures\u201d\nhave been adopted to avoid errors.

If anything, we\nshould expect Congress to think that such behavior should\nbe encouraged, not discouraged.\n   The Court also suggests that reading \u00a71692k(c) to in\nclude legal errors would encourage litigation over a num\nber of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liabil\nity; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes;\nwhat standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney\ndebt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collec\ntors. Yet these questions are no different from ones al\nready raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is\nan attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be\nassessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to\navoid mistakes\u2014whether legal or otherwise\u2014must be\n\u201creasonable,\u201d which is always a context-specific inquiry.\nThe Court provides no reason to think that legal errors\nraise concerns that differ in these respects from those\nraised by non-legal errors.\n                              2\n   There is a further and most serious reason to interpret\n\u00a71692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In Heintz\nv. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995), the Court held that at\ntorneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be \u201cdebt\ncollectors\u201d for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this\nconclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its\ninterpretation would produce the anomalous result that\nattorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against\ndebtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.\nId., at 295. The Court rejected this argument. In doing so\nit said that \u00a71692k(c) provides debt collectors with a de\nfense for their bona fide errors. Id., at 295.\n   Today the Court relies on Heintz to allay concerns about\nthe practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 25. Yet\nthe Court reads \u00a71692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law,\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthereby producing the very result that Heintz said would\nnot come about. Attorneys may now be held liable for\ntaking reasonable legal positions in good faith if those\npositions are ultimately rejected.\n   Attorneys are duty-bound to represent their clients with\ndiligence, creativity, and painstaking care, all within the\nconfines of the law. When statutory provisions have not\nyet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advo\ncacy is to be prized, not punished. Surely this includes\noffering interpretations of a statute that are permissible,\neven if not yet settled. The FDCPA is a complex statute,\nand its provisions are subject to different interpretations.\nSee, e.g., ante, at 5, n. 4 (identifying splits of authority on\ntwo different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Associa\ntion of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 5\u20136\n(identifying another split); see also ante, at 12. Attorneys\nwill often find themselves confronted with a statutory\nprovision that is susceptible to different but still reason\nable interpretations.\n   An attorney\u2019s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to\ngive the client his or her best professional assessment of\nthe law\u2019s mandate. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation of\nthe FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney\nvulnerable to suit. For if the attorney proceeds based on\nan interpretation later rejected by the courts, today\u2019s\ndecision deems that to be actionable as an intentional\n\u201cviolation,\u201d with personal financial liability soon to follow.\nIndeed, even where a particular practice is compelled by\nexisting precedent, the attorney may be sued if that prece\ndent is later overturned.\n   These adverse consequences are evident in the instant\ncase. When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint\nagainst Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no\nreason to doubt that the debt was valid. They had every\nreason, furthermore, to believe that they were on solid\nlegal ground in asking her to dispute the amount owed in\n\f12          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nwriting. See, e.g., Graziano v. Harrison, 950 F. 2d 107,\n112 (CA3 1991) (written objection is necessary for coherent\nstatutory scheme and protects the debtor by \u201ccreat[ing] a\nlasting record of the fact that the debt has been disputed\u201d).\nWhen Jerman disputed the debt, respondents verified that\nthe debt had been satisfied and withdrew the lawsuit.\nRespondents acted reasonably at every step, and yet may\nstill find themselves liable for a harmless violation.\n   After today\u2019s ruling, attorneys can be punished for\nadvocacy reasonably deemed to be in compliance with the\nlaw or even required by it. This distorts the legal process.\nHenceforth, creditors\u2019 attorneys of the highest ethical\nstanding are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly inter\npretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves\nincur personal financial risk. It is most disturbing that\nthis Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will\ninterject an attorney\u2019s personal financial interests into the\nprofessional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client\nrelationship. These consequences demonstrate how un\ntenable the Court\u2019s statutory interpretation is and counsel\nin favor of a different reading. See Milavetz, Gallop &\nMilavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5\n(2010) (slip op., at 16, n. 5) (rejecting a reading of federal\nlaw that \u201cwould seriously undermine the attorney-client\nrelationship\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s response is that this possibility is nothing\nnew, because attorneys are already duty-bound to comply\nwith the law and with standards of professional conduct.\nAttorneys face sanctions for harassing behavior and frivo\nlous litigation, and in some cases misconduct may give rise\nto personal liability. Ante, at 25\u201326.\n   This response only underscores the problem with the\nCourt\u2019s approach. By reading \u00a71692k(c) to exclude mis\ntakes of law, the Court ensures that attorneys will face\nliability even when they have done nothing wrong\u2014\nindeed, even when they have acted in accordance with\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Here respondents\u2019 law\nfirm did not harass Jerman; it did not file a frivolous suit\nagainst her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused\nher no damages or injury. The firm acted upon a reason\nable legal interpretation that the District Court later\nthought to be mistaken. The District Court\u2019s position, as\nall concede, was in conflict with other published, reasoned\nopinions. Ante, at 4, n. 2. (And in the instant case, nei\nther the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the\nissue. See ante, at 5, n. 3.) If the law firm can be pun\nished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe\nan attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly\ninterpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow\nif some later decision adopts a different rule. This dy\nnamic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney\nclient relationship but also for First Amendment rights.\nCf. Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,\n545 (2001) (law restricting arguments available to attor\nneys \u201cprohibits speech and expression upon which courts\nmust depend for the proper exercise of the judicial\npower\u201d). We need not decide that these concerns rise to\nthe level of an independent constitutional violation, see\nante, at 29, n. 21, to recognize that they counsel against a\nproblematic interpretation of the statute. See Edward J.\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr.\nTrades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) (\u201c[W]here an\notherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise\nserious constitutional problems, the Court will construe\nthe statute to avoid such problems unless such construc\ntion is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress\u201d).\n   JUSTICE BREYER\u2014although not the Court\u2014argues that\nan attorney faced with legal uncertainty only needs to\nturn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for an advi\nsory opinion. An attorney\u2019s actions in conformity with the\nopinion will be shielded from liability. Ante, at 1 (concur\nring opinion) (citing 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(e)). This argument\n\f14         JERMAN v.

Filings\nand motions are made under pressing time constraints;\narguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic\ndecisions must be taken in the face of incomplete informa\ntion. Lawyers in practice would not consider this alterna\ntive at all realistic, particularly where the defense is\nneeded most.\n   And even were there time to generate a formal request\nto the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for\na response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argu\nment assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious,\nnot latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that\na conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be\nmade. But the problem in many instances is that inter\npretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may\nexplain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only\nfour opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27\u201328, 30. The FTC advisory process does not\nremedy the difficulties that the Court\u2019s opinion will cause.\n   Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethi\ncal dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts\na position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still\nbelieve the FTC is mistaken. Yet under today\u2019s decision,\nthe attorney who in good faith continues to assert a rea\nsonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal\nliability. This alters the ethical balance central to the\nadversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court\nto adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to\navoid systemic disruption.\n                            II\n  The Court does not assert that its interpretation is\nclearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies\non an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are\nsaid to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.\nThis does not withstand scrutiny.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   First, the Court relies on the maxim that \u201c \u2018ignorance of\nthe law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi\nnally.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet.\n404, 411 (1833)). There is no doubt that this principle \u201cis\ndeeply rooted in the American legal system.\u201d Cheek v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). Yet it is unhelp\nful to the Court\u2019s position. The maxim the Court cites is\nbased on the premise \u201cthat the law is definite and know\nable,\u201d so that all must be deemed to know its mandate.\nIbid. See also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881)\n(\u201c[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to\nencourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined\nto make men know and obey\u201d). In other words, citizens\ncannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demon\nstrating a failure to learn it.\n   The most straightforward application of this principle is\nto statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohib\nited conduct. These statutes will not be read to excuse\nlegal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature\nmeant to do so. See, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United\nStates, 209 U. S. 56, 70, 85\u201386 (1908) (rejecting the defen\ndant\u2019s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a\ncriminal statute forbidding shippers to \u201cobtain or dispose\nof property at less than the regular rate established\u201d);\nante, at 7\u20138 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability\nfor \u201cintentional discrimination\u201d).\n   In the present case, however, the Court is not asked\nwhether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from\na general prohibition that would otherwise cover their\nconduct. Rather, the issue is the scope of an express ex\nception to a general prohibition. There is good reason to\nthink the distinction matters. It is one thing to presume\nthat Congress does not intend to create an exception to a\ngeneral rule through silence; it is quite another to pre\nsume that an explicit statutory exception should be con\nfined despite the existence of other sensible interpreta\n\f16          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions. Cf. Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9\n(1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives\nsovereign immunity, \u201cthe proper objective of a court at\ntempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify\nthose circumstances which are within the words and\nreason of the exception\u2014no less and no more\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true\nwhere the other possible interpretations are more consis\ntent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its\nterms, \u00a71692k(c) encompasses\u2014without limitation\u2014all\nviolations that are \u201cnot intentional and resul[t] from a\nbona fide error.\u201d The Court provides no reason to read\nthis language narrowly.\n   The Court responds that \u201cour precedents have made\nclear for more than 175 years\u201d that the presumption\nagainst mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit\nstatutory exceptions. Ante, 6\u20137, n. 5. By this the Court\nmeans that one case applied the presumption to an excep\ntion more than 175 years ago. In Barlow, the Court de\nclined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statu\ntory provision that excepted \u201cfalse denomination[s] . . .\n[that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any\nintention to defraud the revenue.\u201d 7 Pet., at 406. In\nconstruing this language, the Barlow Court noted that it\ndemonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of\nlaw:\n     \u201cThe very association of mistake and accident, in this\n     [connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume\n     that the legislature had the same classes of cases in\n     view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law,\n     seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso,\n     as accidents in the construction of the law.\u201d Id., at\n     411\u2013412.\nUnlike the provision at issue in Barlow, \u00a71692k(c) gives no\nindication that its broad reference to \u201cbona fide error[s]\u201d\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwas meant to exclude legal mistakes.\n   Even if statutory exceptions should normally be con\nstrued to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guide\nline would only apply absent intent to depart from the\ngeneral rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create\na mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has\ndone so here. See Ratzlaf, 510 U. S, at 149. As explained\nabove, see Part I\u2013A, supra, Congress has made its choice\nplain by using the word \u201cviolation\u201d in \u00a71692k(c) to indicate\nthat mistakes of law are to be included.\n   Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between\n\u00a71692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal\nTrade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a741 et seq. Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face\ncivil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with\n\u201cactual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis\nof objective circumstances that [an] act is\u201d prohibited\nunder the FDCPA. \u00a7\u00a745(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858\n(2009) (amending 16 CFR \u00a71.98(d) (2009)). The Court\nreasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide rela\ntively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By con\ntrast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA\nitself must cover\u2014and hence \u00a71692k(c) must not excuse\u2014\nunintentional violations. Ante, at 8\u20139.\n   The argument rests on a mistaken premise\u2014namely,\nthat \u00a71692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.\nThis misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies\nonly to \u201cbona fide\u201d errors committed despite \u201cthe mainte\nnance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid\u201d these\nmistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute,\n(1) intentional violations are punishable under the height\nened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations\nare generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA;\nand (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by\nproving that a violation was based on a bona fide error\nand that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in\n\f18          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nplace. There is nothing incongruous in this scheme.\nIndeed, for the reasons described in Part I, supra, it is far\nless peculiar than the Court\u2019s reading, which would sub\nject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy,\neven advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then\nexisting case law.\n    Third, in construing \u00a71692k(c) to exclude legal errors,\nthe Court points to the requirement that a debt collector\nmaintain \u201cprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any\nsuch error.\u201d The Court asserts that this phrase most\nnaturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual\nmistakes. There is nothing natural in reading this phrase\ncontrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish be\ntween different categories of mistakes. Nor is there any\nthing unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal\nmistakes. The present case is again instructive. Accord\ning to the District Court, respondents designated a lead\nFDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended\nconferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodi\ncals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys;\ntrained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and\nheld regular firm-wide meetings on FDCPA issues. See\n538 F. 3d 469, 477 (CA6 2008). These procedures are not\nonly \u201creasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],\u201d but also\naccord with the FDCPA\u2019s purposes.\n    The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contem\nplates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type\nof errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through\n\u201c \u2018a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1807 (1976)). As made clear by the steps\nthat respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compli\nance, this is simply not true. The Court also speculates\nthat procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be\neasier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors.\nEven if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwith what the statute requires. The statute does not talk\nabout procedures that eliminate all\u2014or even most\u2014\nerrors. It merely requires procedures \u201creasonably adapted\nto avoid any such error.\u201d The statute adopts the sensible\napproach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is\nto be avoided. This approach, not the Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.\n   Fourth, the Court argues that construing \u00a71692k(c) to\nencompass a mistake-of-law defense \u201cis at odds with\u201d the\nrole contemplated for the FTC. Ante, at 13. This is so, it\ncontends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory\nopinions, and the statute shields from liability \u201cany act\ndone or omitted in good faith in conformity\u201d with such\nopinions. \u00a71692k(e). But why, asks the Court, would a\ndebt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity\nunder \u00a71692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in\ngood faith on advice from private counsel? Going further,\nthe Court suggests that debt collectors might \u201chave an\naffirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to\nresolve ambiguity in the law, which would then prevent\nthem from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.\u201d\nAnte, at 13.\n   There is little substance to this line of reasoning. As the\nCourt itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an\nincentive to invoke the FTC safe harbor even if \u00a71692k(c)\nis construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because\nthe safe harbor provides a \u201cmore categorical immunity.\u201d\nAnte, at 13, n. 8. Additionally, if a debt collector avoids\nseeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern\nthat the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at\nodds with saying that his or her ignorance is \u201cbona fide.\u201d\n   It should be noted further that the Court\u2019s concern\nabout encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to\n\u00a745(m)(1)(A). That provision subjects a debt collector to\nharsh penalties for violating an FTC rule \u201cwith actual\nknowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\n\f20         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nobjective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive\nand is prohibited by such rule.\u201d No one contends that this\nwill encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC\u2019s\nrules. Yet there is no doubt that \u00a745(m)(1)(A) permits a\nmistake-of-law defense.\n  All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advi\nsory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For\nthe reasons stated above, see Part I\u2013B\u20132, supra, this is to\nbe doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role\nthat the FTC has played. Ante, at 25 (\u201c[E]vidence of pre\nsent administrative practice makes us reluctant to place\nsignificant weight on \u00a71692k(e) as a practical remedy\u201d).\n  Fifth, the Court asserts that \u201c[a]ny remaining doubt\u201d\nabout its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the\nFDCPA\u2019s statutory history. The Court points to the fact\nthat \u00a71692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision\nin the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), argu\ning that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA\nthe view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense\napplied only to clerical errors. Ante, at 14\u201315. As JUSTICE\nSCALIA points out, the Court\u2019s claims of judicial uniformity\nare overstated. See ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). They rest on three\nCourt of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by\nseveral District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court\nopinion\u2014hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which\nto divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact\nthat those three Courts of Appeals had construed the\nTILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See Ives v.\nW. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); Haynes v.\nLogan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7\n1974); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).\nThe Court therefore cannot explain why it reads \u00a71692k(c)\nmore broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.\n  It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress\namended the TILA\u2019s bona fide error exception explicitly to\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nexclude \u201can error of legal judgment with respect to a per\nson\u2019s obligations under [the TILA].\u201d See Truth in Lending\nSimplification and Reform Act, \u00a7615 (c), 94 Stat. 181. This\namendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had\nunderstood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.\nThe natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA\nlanguage\u2014the same language later incorporated nearly\nverbatim into \u00a71692k(c)\u2014was understood to cover those\nerrors.\n   The Court\u2019s responses to this point are perplexing. The\nCourt first says that the 1980 amendment did not \u201cobvi\nous[ly]\u201d change the scope of the TILA\u2019s bona fide error\ndefense, given the \u201cuniform interpretation\u201d that the de\nfense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at\n17. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory\namendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious\nassumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court\nof Appeals consensus. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[O]ne of the most\nbasic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be\nconstrued so that effect is given to all its provisions, so\nthat no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or\ninsignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; second\nalteration in original)). (Without any evidence, the Court\nspeculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to\ncodify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal\nerrors. Ante, at 17\u201318. If those judicial interpretation\nwere truly as uniform as the Court suggests\u2014and\n the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as\nironclad\u2014there would have been no need for such a\nrecodification.)\n   The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amend\nment weight because Congress \u201chas not expressly included\nmistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error\ndefenses, worded in pertinent part identically to \u00a71692k(c),\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code.\u201d Ante, at 18 (emphasis in\n\f22         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\noriginal). In other words, the Court refuses to read\n\u00a71692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide\nerror statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes. But\nthe reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provi\nsions included mistake-of-law language but \u00a71692k(c) did\nnot, we might think that the omission in \u00a71692k(c) sig\nnaled Congress\u2019s intent to exclude mistakes of law. The\nabsence of mistake-of-law language in \u00a71692k(c) is conse\nquently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit\nsuch language.\n  The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error de\nfenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA,\nexpressly exclude legal errors from their scope. Ante, at\n18 (citing 12 U. S. C. \u00a74010(c)(2)). Yet this also can prove\nthe opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide\nerror defense were generally assumed not to include legal\nmistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to\nexpressly exclude them. It is only if the defense would\notherwise include such errors that exclusionary language\nbecomes necessary. By writing explicit exclusionary lan\nguage into the TILA (and some other federal provisions),\nCongress has indicated that those provisions would other\nwise cover good-faith legal errors.\n                       *     *    *\n   For these reasons, \u00a71692k(c) is best read to encompass\nmistakes of law. I would affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals.\n\f"}

Argued January 20, 2010\u2014Decided April 21, 2010\nPetitioners are Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan\u2019s\n  current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon\n  dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980\u2019s, received lump-sum\n  distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were\n  later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating\n  respondents\u2019 current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter\n  preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as\n  the \u201cphantom account\u201d method. Respondents challenged that method\n  in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n  1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for\n  the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that\n  the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable and that\n  respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac\n  count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,\n  the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan\n  that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre\n  viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential\n  standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach\n  proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of\n  money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the\n  District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re\n  mand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on the merits was not an\n  abuse of discretion.\nHeld: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of\n review to the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\n mand. Pp. 4\u201315.\n    (a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions\n of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n\f2                      CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for\n    guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de\n    pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a\n    trust instrument gives the trustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or\n    doubtful terms, . . . the trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed\n    if reasonable.\u201d Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan\u2019s terms, the Plan\n    Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in\n    terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex\n    ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a\n    deferential standard when a plan administrator\u2019s previous construc\n    tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach has\n    no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference\n    with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This\n    Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,\n    that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in\n    terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of\n    that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should\n    require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit\u2019s decision sup\n    ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were\n    based\u2014the plan\u2019s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA\u2019s purposes.\n    The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author\n    ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to\n    construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re\n    quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA\n    but do not \u201ctell the entire story.\u201d Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,\n    497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts\n    may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good\n    faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.\n       ERISA represents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\n    prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of\n    the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.\n    200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this \u201ccareful balancing\u201d and\n    protects the statute\u2019s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni\n    formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a\n    plan administrator\u2019s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but\n    the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud\n    denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus\n    trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def\n    erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more\n    complicated than necessary. Respondents\u2019 approach threatens to in\n    terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that \u201cwould create fur\n    ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al\n    ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.\u201d Glenn, supra, at ___.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform\n  ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone\n  deference. The District Court\u2019s interpretation does not account for\n  the time value of money, but respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testi\n  fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents\n  do not dispute that the District Court\u2019s approach would place them in\n  a better position than employees who never left the company. If\n  other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of\n  money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in\n  which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations\n  in different States. Pp. 5\u201313.\n     (c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea\n  sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference\n  each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis\n  putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from\n  challenging administrators\u2019 decisions. These concerns are overblown\n  because there is no reason to think that deference would be required\n  in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er\n  roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in\n  good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too\n  incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds\n  of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential\n  standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator\n  will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin\n  istrator\u2019s interpretation \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Fire\n  stone, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA\nplans. That should come as no surprise, given that the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is \u201can\nenormously complex and detailed statute,\u201d Mertens v.\nHewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 262 (1993), and the plans\nthat administrators must construe can be lengthy and\ncomplicated. (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with\n139 sections.) We held in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nBruch, 489 U. S. 101 (1989), that an ERISA plan adminis\ntrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is\nentitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The\nquestion here is whether a single honest mistake in plan\ninterpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that\ndeference for subsequent related interpretations of the\nplan. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are\nexceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual\ndetails are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we\n\f2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns\nXerox Corporation\u2019s pension plan, which is covered by\nERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et seq.\nPetitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the\nPlan\u2019s current and former administrators (hereinafter\nPlan Administrator). See \u00a71002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re\nspondents are Xerox employees who left the company in\nthe 1980\u2019s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement\nbenefits they had earned up to that point, and were later\nrehired. See 328 F. Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief\nfor Respondents 9\u201310. The dispute giving rise to this case\nconcerns how to account for respondents\u2019 past distribu\ntions when calculating their current benefits\u2014that is, how\nto avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.\n   The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to\ncall for an approach that has come to be known as the\n\u201cphantom account\u201d method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.\nEssentially, that method calculated the hypothetical\ngrowth that respondents\u2019 past distributions would have\nexperienced if the money had remained in Xerox\u2019s invest\nment funds, and reduced respondents\u2019 present benefits\naccordingly. See id., at 426\u2013428; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents\u2019\nadministrative challenges to that method, respondents\nfiled suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428\u2013429. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,\napplying a deferential standard of review to the Plan\nAdministrator\u2019s interpretation. See id., at 430\u2013431, 439.\nThe Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that\nthe Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable\nand that respondents had not been adequately notified\nthat the phantom account method would be used to calcu\nlate their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265\u2013269\n(2006).\n   The phantom account method having been exorcised\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Plan, the District Court on remand considered\nother approaches for adjusting respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.\n2d 452, 456\u2013458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator\nsubmitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like\nthe phantom account method, accounted for the time value\nof the money that respondents had previously received.\nBut unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin\nistrator\u2019s new approach did not calculate the present value\nof a past distribution based on events that occurred after\nthe distribution was made. Instead, the new approach\nused an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the\ndistribution, thereby calculating the current value of the\ndistribution based on information that was known at the\ntime of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a\u2013\n153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should\napply a deferential standard of review to this approach,\nand accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.\nSee Defendants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies\nin No. 00\u2013CV\u20136311 (WDNY), pp. 7\u20138; Defendants\u2019 Pre-\nHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00\u2013CV\u2013\n6311 (WDNY), p. 2.\n   The District Court did not apply a deferential standard\nof review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am\nbiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed\nby respondents that did not account for the time value of\nmoney. Under that approach, respondents\u2019 present bene\nfits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past\ndistributions\u2014thereby treating a dollar distributed to\nrespondents in the 1980\u2019s as equal in value to a dollar\ndistributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457\u2013458. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the\nDistrict Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan\ndard on remand, and that the District Court\u2019s decision on\nthe merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d\n\f4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n111, 119 (2008).\n   Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques\ntions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the Plan on re\nmand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly\ngranted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.\n                              II\n                               A\n   This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the\ndecisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489\nU. S. 101. Because ERISA\u2019s text does not directly resolve\nthe matter, we looked to \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d for guid\nance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust\nlaw, the proper standard of review of a trustee\u2019s decision\ndepends on the language of the instrument creating the\ntrust. See id., at 111\u2013112. If the trust documents give the\ntrustee \u201cpower to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .\nthe trustee\u2019s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason\nable.\u201d Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held\nthat \u201ca denial of benefits challenged under \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\nis to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre\ntionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\nconstrue the terms of the plan.\u201d Id., at 115.\n   We expanded Firestone\u2019s approach in Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the\nproper standard of review when a plan administrator\noperates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to\ntrust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles\nof ERISA\u2014plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6\u20137, 9\u201310). We held that,\nwhen the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to\nthe plan administrator, a deferential standard of review\n\f                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nremains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of\nthe Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be\nentitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328\nF. Supp. 2d, at 430\u2013431 (observing that the Plan grants\nthe Plan Administrator \u201cbroad discretion in making deci\nsions relative to the Plan\u201d). The Court of Appeals, how\never, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi\ncally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a\ndeferential standard \u201cwhere the administrator ha[s] previ\nously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such\na construction to have violated ERISA.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 119.\nUnder that view, the District Court here was entitled to\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by\nthe Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap\npeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.       Cf. ibid. (accepting the District\nCourt\u2019s chosen method as one of \u201cseveral reasonable\nalternatives\u201d).\n                               B\n  We reject this \u201cone-strike-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d approach.\nBrief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no\nbasis in the Court\u2019s holding in Firestone, which set out a\nbroad standard of deference without any suggestion that\nthe standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the\none adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at\n111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception\nto Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA\nlaw was already complicated enough without adding\n\u201cspecial procedural or evidentiary rules\u201d to the mix. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a\nsystemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis\ntrator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi\ncult to see why a single honest mistake would require a\n\f6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent result.\n  Nor is the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision supported by the\nconsiderations on which our holdings in Firestone and\nGlenn were based\u2014namely, the terms of the plan, princi\nples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,\nat 4\u20135. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator\ngeneral authority to \u201c[c]onstrue the Plan.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 141a\u2013142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that\nthe grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe\nthe Plan.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019 exception to Firestone\ndeference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust\nlaw is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading\ntreatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis\ncretion when there is reason to believe that he will not\nexercise that discretion fairly\u2014for example, upon a show\ning that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:\n    \u201cIf the trustee\u2019s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to\n    the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer\n    cise [the trustee\u2019s] discretion honestly and fairly, the\n    court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself.

Another treatise states that, after a\ntrustee has abused his discretion, \u201c[s]ometimes the court\ndecides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating\nthe exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some\nlimits on the trustee\u2019s action and giving him leeway within\nthose limits.\u201d G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and\nTrustees \u00a7560, p. 223 (2d rev. ed. 1980).\n  The unclear state of trust law on the question was per\nhaps best captured by the Texas Supreme Court:\n    \u201cThere is authority for ordering a dismissal of the case\n    to afford the trustee an opportunity to exercise a rea\n    sonable discretion in arriving at the amount of pay\n    ments to be made in the light of our discussion of the\n    problem and after a proper consideration of the many\n    factors involved. On the other hand, there is author\n    ity for remanding the case to the trial court to hear\n    evidence and in the exercise of its supervisory juris\n    diction to fix the amount of such payments. There is\n    still other authority for remanding the case to the\n    trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a\n    reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee\n    within maximum and minimum limits.\u201d State v.\n    Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 54\u201355, 308 S.

S., at 111, we have recog\nnized before that \u201ctrust law does not tell the entire story,\u201d\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996); see ibid.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Here trust law does not\nresolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi\nples we have identified underlying ERISA do.\n   Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees\nwould receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress\ndid not require employers to establish benefit plans in the\nfirst place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887\n(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre\nsents a \u201c \u2018careful balancing\u2019 between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.\u201d Aetna Health\nInc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life\nIns. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress\nsought \u201cto create a system that is [not] so complex that\nadministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis\ncourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first\nplace.\u201d Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA \u201cinduc[es]\nemployers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of\nliabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\nand a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and\nawards when a violation has occurred.\u201d Rush Prudential\nHMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 379 (2002).\n   Firestone deference protects these interests and, by\npermitting an employer to grant primary interpretive\nauthority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator,\npreserves the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d on which ERISA is\nbased. Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging\nresolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis\ntrative proceedings rather than costly litigation. It also\npromotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the\n\f10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpertise of the plan administrator rather than worry\nabout unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that\nmight result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,\nFirestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,\nhelping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of\na plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ\nent jurisdictions\u2014a result that \u201cwould introduce consider\nable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which\nmight lead those employers with existing plans to reduce\nbenefits, and those without such plans to refrain from\nadopting them.\u201d Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\nU. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries\ntells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an\nERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by\nfederal law, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is\ninterpreted to mean different things in different places.\nSee Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5\u201311.\n   Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do\nnot question that deference to plan administrators serves\nthese important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer\nence is less important once a plan administrator has is\nsued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.\nBut the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform\nity\u2014and the manner in which they are promoted by defer\nence to reasonable plan construction by administrators\u2014\ndo not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis\ntrator has made a single honest mistake.\n   This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter\nest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by\ngranting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the\nPlan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis\ntrict Court had applied a deferential standard of review\nunder Firestone, the question before it would have been\nwhether the Plan Administrator\u2019s interpretation of the\nPlan was reasonable. After answering that question, the\ncase might well have been over. Instead, the District\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the\nmore complicated question of how best to interpret the\nPlan.\n   The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in\nrespondents\u2019 approach does not end there. Under respon\ndents\u2019 and the Government\u2019s view, the question whether a\ndeferential standard of review was required in this case\nturns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting\nthe \u201csame terms\u201d or deciding the \u201csame issue\u201d on remand.\nSee Brief for Respondents 43, 46\u201348, 53, and n. 13; Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 13\u201315, 23. Whether\nthat condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,\npetitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the\nPlan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on\nremand\u2014how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific\nprovisions requiring use of the phantom account method\ncould not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 50\u201351. Respondents would force\nthe parties to litigate this potentially complicated \u201csame\nissue\u201d or \u201csame terms\u201d question before a district court\ncould even decide whether deference is owed to a plan\nadministrator\u2019s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is\nlittle place in the ERISA context for these sorts of \u201cspecial\nprocedural rules [that] would create further complexity,\nadding time and expense to a process that may already be\ntoo costly for many of those who seek redress.\u201d 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   The position of respondents and the Government could\ninterject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For\nexample, even under their view, the District Court here\ncould have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;\nthe court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for\nRespondents 43, 49\u201350, 52\u201353; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23\u201324. That raises the question of how a\ncourt is to decide between the two options; respondents\u2019\nanswer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,\n\f12               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40\u201345.\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in\npredictability that would result from stripping a plan\nadministrator of Firestone deference. After declining to\napply a deferential standard here, the District Court\nadopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac\ncount for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at\n458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is\nheresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries\ntell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan\nresembling this one that did not include some adjustment\nfor the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as\nAmici Curiae 12.\n  Respondents\u2019 own actuarial expert testified before the\nDistrict Court that fairness would require recognizing the\ntime value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,\n130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis\npute that the District Court\u2019s approach, which does not\naccount for the fact that respondents were able to use\ntheir past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,\nwould place respondents in a better position than employ\nees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents\n42\u201343; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32\u201333.\nDeference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all\nbeneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for\nparticular employees.\n  Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems\nthat arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone\ndeference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation\nof the Plan that does account for the time value of money,\nXerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar\nXerox employees could be entitled to different benefits\ndepending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring\na legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(e)(2) (permitting suit\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

In\nfact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation\nover the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of\nthe phantom account method, but held that the Plan\nAdministrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac\ncounting for rehired employees\u2019 past distributions\u2014which\nwould presumably include taking some cognizance of the\ntime value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement\nIncome Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875\u2013876 (2006);\nBrief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene\nfits Council as Amici Curiae 8\u20139. Thus, failing to defer to\nthe Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to\nbe subject to different interpretations in California and\nNew York. \u201cUniformity is impossible, however, if plans\nare subject to different legal obligations in different\nStates.\u201d Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).\nFirestone deference serves to avoid that result and to\npreserve the \u201ccareful balancing\u201d of interests that ERISA\nrepresents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.\n                               C\n   In spite of all this, respondents and the Government\nargue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone\ndeference in this case would actually disserve the purposes\nof ERISA. They argue that continued deference would\nencourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable\ninterpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis\ntrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their\nplans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they\nargue that plan administrators would be able to proceed\nseriatim through several interpretations of their plans,\neach time receiving deference, thereby undermining the\nprompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up\nlitigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal\nlenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.\n\f14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that\ndeference would be required in the extreme circumstances\nthat respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may\nbe stripped of deference when he does not exercise his\ndiscretion \u201chonestly and fairly.\u201d 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.\nMultiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi\nsion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a\nfinding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to\nexercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of\ncostly litigation that respondents fear.\n   Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean\nthat the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It\nmeans only that the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation of\nthe plan \u201cwill not be disturbed if reasonable.\u201d Firestone,\n489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (\u201c \u2018Where discretion is\nconferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a\npower, its exercise is not subject to control by the court\nexcept to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre\ntion\u2019 \u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187)).\nThus, far from \u201cimpos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re\nquirement\u201d that courts must defer to plan administrators,\npost, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should\nhave applied the standard established in Firestone and\nGlenn.\n                            III\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District\nCourt could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the\nCourt of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta\ntion by the Administrator to be invalid. Because we re\nverse on that ground, we do not reach the question\nwhether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a\ndeferential standard of review to the decision of the Dis\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

To explain my view, I shall describe the\nthree significant mistakes involved in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation\u2019s pension\nplan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan\nAdministrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under\u00ad\nstand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon\nretirement. App. 29a\u201331a. These benefits are calculated\nas follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of\nthe Plan):\n    (1) \u201cThe Pension\u201d: Take your average salary for your\n    five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per\u00ad\n    cent; and multiply again by the number of years you\n    worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a\u201311a, 29a\u201330a.\n    Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid\n    years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30\n    years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per\n    year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 percent \u00d7 30).\n    (2) \u201cThe Cash Account\u201d: Every year, Xerox credits 5\n\f2               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.\n    This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1\n    percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at\n    41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your cash account and convert the\n    final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you\n    have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the\n    relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is\n    7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi\u00ad\n    mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap\u00ad\n    proximately $200,000 \u00d77 percent).\n    (3) \u201cThe Investment Account\u201d: Before 1990, Xerox\n    contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at\n    33a\u201334a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the\n    end of 1989 have an investment account that consists\n    of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit\n    sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in\u00ad\n    vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a\u2013\n    36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your investment account and con\u00ad\n    vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.\n    Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued\n    $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity\n    rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you\n    would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000\n    per year upon your retirement (approximately\n    $400,000 \u00d7 7 percent).\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee\u2019s pen\u00ad\nsion would come from the investment account, and the\nemployee would receive $28,000 per year.\n  This case concerns one aspect of Xerox\u2019s retirement\nplan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees\nwho leave Xerox and later return, working for additional\nyears before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long\ntreated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(again, I simplify and use my own words):\n   First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a\nlump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has\naccrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,\nher cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of\n1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.\n   Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to\naccrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a\u201341a, start\u00ad\ning from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment\naccount, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing\ncontributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re\u00ad\ntirement the employee may not have accrued much money\nin this account.\n   Third, a rehired employee\u2019s pension is calculated in the\nway I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox\n(both before her departure and after her return) taken into\naccount. See Brief for Petitioners 9\u201310.\n   Fourth, the employee\u2019s benefits calculation is adjusted\nto take account of the fact that the employee has already\nreceived a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.\n32a; Brief for Petitioners 10\u201311.\n   This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur\u00ad\ning step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad\u00ad\nministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the\nfact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has\nalready received a distribution when she initially left\nXerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the\nadjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ\u00ad\nously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the\namount that would have existed in the investment account\nhad no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee\nhad not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her\ninvestment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would\nlikely have increased dramatically\u2014perhaps doubling,\ntripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how\nwell the Plan\u2019s investments performed.\n\f4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is this hypothetical sum\u2014termed the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount,\u201d ante, at 2\u2014that is at issue in this case. Xerox\u2019s\npre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this\nhypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire\u00ad\nment from the company, and in effect subtracted the\namount from the employee\u2019s benefits upon her departure.\nBrief for Petitioners 10\u201311; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on\nhow the Plan\u2019s investments did over time, the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s use of this \u201cphantom account\u201d could have a substan\u00ad\ntial impact on a rehired employee\u2019s benefits. (See Appen\u00ad\ndix, infra, for an example of how this \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks.)\n   When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox\u2019s Em\u00ad\nployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\nPlan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an\n\u201cinadverten[t]\u201d omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In\na section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100\nleaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,\nthe Plan said that it would \u201coffset\u201d the retiring employees\u2019\n\u201caccrued benefit\u201d (as ordinarily calculated) \u201cby the accrued\nbenefit attributable\u201d to the prior lump-sum \u201cdistribution\u201d\nthose employees received when they initially left Xerox.\nApp. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would\ncalculate this \u201coffset.\u201d In other words, the Plan said noth\u00ad\ning about the Administrator\u2019s use of the \u201cphantom ac\u00ad\ncount.\u201d\n   This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the\nPlan\u2019s failure to include language explaining how the\nAdministrator would take into account an employee\u2019s prior\ndistribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology. In essence, the\nAdministrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language\nthat had been omitted\u2014an interpretation that, as de\u00ad\nscribed below, see Part I\u2013B, infra, the Court of Appeals\nfound to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of\nERISA.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who\nleft and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.\nAnte, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii\u2013iii, 12. They pointed out\nthat the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re\u00ad\ntirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already\nreceived a lump-sum benefits distribution when they\ninitially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989\nPlan, nor the 1989 Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description, said\nanything about whether (or how) the Administrator would\nadjust their previous benefits distribution to take into\naccount that they had received the distribution well before\ntheir retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin\u00ad\nistrator could not use the \u201cphantom account\u201d methodology\nto adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 4\u20135.\n   The District Court, however, rejected respondents\u2019\nclaims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004). The court\naccepted the Administrator\u2019s argument that the 1989 Plan\nimplicitly incorporated the \u201cphantom account\u201d approach\nthat had previously been part of Xerox\u2019s retirement plan.\nId., at 433\u2013434. And the court thus held in favor of peti\u00ad\ntioners\u2014thereby committing the second mistake in this\ncase. Id., at 439.\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court and vacated the District Court\u2019s decision in\nrelevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about\nhow the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits\ndistributions, it was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d for the\nAdministrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in\u00ad\ncorporated the \u201cphantom account.\u201d Id., at 265\u2013266, and\nn. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan\u00ad\nguage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at\nthe least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents\n\f6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith fair notice that the Administrator was going to use\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d approach. See id., at 265 (discuss\u00ad\ning 29 U.

Rather, the court noted, respondents \u201clikely\nbelieved\u201d\u2014based on the language of the Plan\u2014\u201cthat their\npast distributions would only be factored into their [cur\u00ad\nrent] benefits calculations by taking into account the\namounts they had actually received.\u201d 433 F. 3d, at 267.\n  In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec\u00ad\nognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations\u2014a remedy\nthat took into account the previous benefits distributions\nrespondents had received in a manner consistent with the\n1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court, with the following instructions:\n    \u201cOn remand, the remedy crafted by the district court\n    for those employees [in the respondents\u2019 situation]\n    should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula\u00ad\n    tion to determine their benefits.

The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that\nwould adjust respondents\u2019 previous benefits distributions\nby adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator\nsuggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new\nhires.

The District Court rejected these suggestions and\nconcluded that the \u201cappropriate\u201d remedy was the one\nsuggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the\nprior distributions received by respondents.              472\nF.

As the\nmajority recognizes, ante, at 4, \u201cprinciples of trust law\u201d\nguide this Court in \u201cdetermining the appropriate stan\u00ad\ndard\u201d by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan\nadministrator.

And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,\nwhere an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre\u00ad\ntionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re\nquires a court to defer to the plan administrator\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____\n(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that\ntrust law \u201cdoes not resolve the specific issue before\u201d the\nCourt in this case\u2014i.e., whether a court is required to\ndefer to an administrator\u2019s second attempt at interpreting\nplan documents, even after the court has already deter\u00ad\nmined that the administrator\u2019s first attempt amounted to\nan abuse of discretion.

FROMMERT\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid\nand inflexible requirement.\n   The Second Circuit found the Administrator\u2019s interpre\u00ad\ntation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in\nviolation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District\nCourt\u2019s task on remand was to \u201ccraf[t]\u201d a \u201cremedy.\u201d See\n433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in\nthese circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its\nown discretion rather than defer to a trustee\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees \u00a7560, pp. 222\u2013223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of\ndiscretion, a court may \u201cdecid[e] for the trustee how he\nshould act,\u201d possibly by \u201cstating the exact result\u201d the court\n\u201cdesires to achieve\u201d); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts \u00a750, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)\n(\u201cA discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is\nsubject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta\u00ad\ntion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee\u201d); 1 Restate\u00ad\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter\nSecond Restatement) (\u201cWhere discretion is conferred upon\nthe trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the\ncourt, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his\ndiscretion\u201d); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges\ndeciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,\nColton v. Colton, 127 U.

In short, the controlling trust law princi\u00ad\nple appears to be that, \u201c[w]here the court finds that there\nhas been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to\nbe rendered is in its discretion.\u201d Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at\n222.\n   Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre\u00ad\ntion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion\nin all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of\nScott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is \u201cno\nreason\u201d to doubt that a trustee \u201cwill . . . fairly exercise\u201d his\n\u201cdiscretion,\u201d then courts \u201cordinarily will not fix the\namount\u201d of a payment \u201cbut will instead direct the trustee\nto make reasonable provision for the beneficiary\u2019s sup\u00ad\nport,\u201d 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and\nAscher on Trusts \u00a718.2.1, pp. 1348\u20131349 (5th ed. 2007)\n(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there\nare situations in which a court will typically defer to a\ntrustee\u2019s remedial suggestion.      The word \u201cordinarily\u201d\nconfirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog\u00ad\nnize that there are instances in which courts will not\ndefer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust\nlaw gives the district courts authority to decide which\ninstances are which. See Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at 222\u2013\n223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court \u201cmay set\naside the transaction,\u201d \u201caward damages to the benefici\u00ad\nary,\u201d or \u201corder a new decision to be made in the light of\nrules expounded by the court\u201d); 2 Third Restatement \u00a750,\nand Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op\u00ad\ntions); 1 Second Restatement \u00a7187, and Comment b, at\n402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement \u00a787, and Com\u00ad\nment c, at 244\u2013245 (noting that \u201cjudicial intervention on\nthe ground of abuse\u201d is allowed when a \u201cgood-faith,\u201d yet\n\u201cunreasonable,\u201d decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,\nsupra, at 54\u201355, 308 S.

FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as\nestablishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to\na trustee\u2019s fallback position absent \u201creason to believe that\n[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly\u2014for\nexample, upon a showing that the trustee has already\nacted in bad faith.\u201d Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,\nthe majority further concludes that the existence of the\nScott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under\nbasic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a\nremedy for a trustee\u2019s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6\u20139.\n  It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the\npassage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ\u00ad\ners, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8\n(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so\neasily be read as consistent with one another. I simply\nread the Scott treatise language as identifying circum\u00ad\nstances in which courts typically choose to defer to an\nadministrator\u2019s fallback position. The treatise does not\nsuggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own\nin the exercise of its broad remedial authority\u2014authority\nthat trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139.\n  A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under\u00ad\nstanding. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the\npassage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott\n\u00a718.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state\nthat a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if\na trustee has previously abused its discretion. See Old\nColony Trust Co. v. Rodd, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N. E.\n2d 886, 889 (1970) (\u201cA court of equity may control a trus\u00ad\ntee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to\nobserve standards of judgment apparent from the applica\u00ad\nble instrument\u201d); In re Marre\u2019s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190,\n114 P. 2d 586, 590\u2013591 (1941) (\u201cIt is well settled that the\ncourts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has\nbeen confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Three other cases are inapposite because\ntheir circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse\nof discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler\u2019s Trusts, 157\nSo. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist.

In the final case, the\ncourt decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to\ncontrol the trustees\u2019 discretion. See Estate of Stillman,\n107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y.

Which of these cases says that, after the\ntrustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still\ndefer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a\nsingle case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the\nmajority\u2019s reading of the treatise.\n   The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott\ntreatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise\ndoes not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court\nthought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised\njudgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee\nto do so. See In re Sullivan\u2019s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40\u201341, 12\n\f12                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nN.

H. 458, 460\u2013461, 183\nA. 271, 272\u2013273 (1936).\n   I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to\nwhich the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a\ngeneral matter, is required to defer to a trust administra\u00ad\ntor\u2019s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am\naware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and\nBogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in\nwhich courts have remedied a trustee\u2019s abuse of discretion\nby ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2\nThird Restatement \u00a750, Reporter\u2019s Note, at 283 (citing\ncases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566\n(1922)); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases\nsuch as Rubion); 3 Scott \u00a718.2.1, at 1348\u20131349, nn. 3\u20134\n(citing cases such as Emmert v.

The Second\nCircuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand\nwas in essence a remedial problem. See 433 F. 3d, at 268.\nIt added that the remedial problem was \u201cdifficul[t]\u201d and\nthat \u201cthe district court . . . may wish to employ equitable\nprinciples when determining the appropriate calculation\nand fashioning the appropriate remedy.\u201d Ibid. The Ad\u00ad\nministrator had previously abused his discretionary\npower. Id., at 265\u2013268. And the District Court found that\nthe Administrator\u2019s primary remedial suggestion on re\u00ad\nmand\u2014adjusting respondents\u2019 previous benefits distribu\u00ad\ntions by adding interest\u2014probably would have violated\nERISA\u2019s notice provisions. 472 F.

Under\nthese circumstances, the District Court reasonably could\nhave found a need to use its own remedial judgment,\nrather than rely on the Administrator\u2019s\u2014which is just\nwhat the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.\n   Moreover, even if the \u201cnarrow\u201d trust law \u201cquestion\nbefore us\u201d were difficult, ante, at 6\u2014which it is not\u2014this\ndifficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its\nbest to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects\nbasic principles of trust law. \u201cCongress invoked the com\u00ad\nmon law of trusts\u201d in enacting ERISA, and this Court has\nthus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine\n\u201cthe particular duties and powers\u201d of ERISA plan adminis\u00ad\ntrators.

S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other\ncase in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on\nthe basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule\nbased on nothing but \u201cthe guiding principles we have\nidentified underlying ERISA,\u201d ante, at 9. See Varity,\nsupra, at 497 (\u201cIn some instances, trust law will offer only\na starting point, after which courts must go on to ask\nwhether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its\nstructure, or its purposes require departing from common\u00ad\nlaw trust requirements\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, it is far from clear that the Court\u2019s legal\nrule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based\npolicy. To the contrary, the majority\u2019s absolute \u201cone free\nhonest mistake\u201d rule is impractical, for it requires courts\nto determine what is \u201chonest,\u201d encourages appeals on the\npoint, and threatens to delay further proceedings that\nalready take too long. (Respondents initially filed this\nretirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have\npointed out\u2014namely, that abuses of discretion \u201carise in\ntoo many contexts\u201d and \u201cconcern too many circumstances\u201d\nfor this Court \u201cto come up with a one-size-fits-all proce\u00ad\ndural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu\u00ad\nrate\u201d benefits determinations.

See ante, at 9\u2013\n13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset\nby the factors discussed above\u2014e.g., discouraging admin\u00ad\nistrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them\naggressively\u2014that argue to the contrary. At best, the\npolicies at issue\u2014some arguing in one direction, some the\nother\u2014are far less able than trust law to provide a \u201cguid\u00ad\ning principle.\u201d Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,\ntrust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to\napproach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.\nSee, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111\u2013113. And trust law\nhere, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the\ndecision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis\u00ad\ntrator\u2019s remedial opinion.\n                            III\n  Since the District Court was not required to defer to the\nAdministrator\u2019s fallback position, I should consider the\nsecond question presented, namely, whether the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the District Court\u2019s decision\nunder an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. Ante, at 4 (ac\u00ad\nknowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to\nthis question depends upon how one characterizes the\n\f16               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision. If the court deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s interpretation of Plan terms, then the\nCourt of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the\ndecision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,\nsupra, at 210 (\u201cAny dispute over the precise terms of the\nplan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan\u00ad\ndard\u201d). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s creation of a remedy, in significant part on\nthe basis of \u201cequitable principles,\u201d then it properly re\u00ad\nviewed the District Court decision for \u201cabuse of discre\u00ad\ntion.\u201d See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\nF. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277\nF. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere\nLife Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.\nW. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).\n   The District Court opinion contains language that sup\u00ad\nports either characterization. On the one hand, the court\nwrote that its task was to \u201cinterpret the Plan as written.\u201d\n472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said\nthat \u201cvirtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the\n[Summary Plan Description]\u201d about how to treat prior\ndistributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the\nCourt of Appeals had directed it to use \u201cequitable princi\u00ad\nples\u201d in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court appears to have used both the Plan language\nand equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See\nid., at 457\u2013459.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports\nboth characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting\nthat the District Court \u201capplied [Plan] terms\u201d in crafting\nits remedy), with id., at 117\u2013119 (describing the District\nCourt\u2019s decision as the \u201ccraft[ing]\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d and\nacknowledging that it had directed the District Court to\nuse \u201cequitable principles\u201d in doing so). But the Court of\nAppeals ultimately treated the District Court\u2019s opinion as\nif it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

And I consequently believe the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the result for an \u201cabuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d\n   Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek\u00ad\ning relief under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), the Court of\nAppeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem\u00ad\nedy as anything other than an application of a plan\u2019s\nterms.

While this provision allows\nplaintiffs only to \u201cenforce\u201d or \u201cclarify\u201d rights or to \u201crecover\nbenefits\u201d \u201cunder the terms of the plan,\u201d \u00a71132(a)(1)(B)\n(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court\u2019s remedial\nauthority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), \u201cCongress\nauthorized \u2018a participant or beneficiary\u2019 to bring a civil\naction . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought\nis legal or equitable\u201d). The provision thus does not pro\u00ad\nhibit a court from shaping relief through the application of\nequitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,\ne.g., 2 Third Restatement \u00a750, and Comment b, at 261\n(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert \u00a7870, at\n123\u2013126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for\nexample, that an administrator provided employees with\ninadequate notice of a plan\u2019s terms (as was true here) may\nhave no alternative but to rely significantly upon those\nprinciples. Cf. 29 U. S. C. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary\nmust \u201cdischarge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as\nsuch documents and instruments are consistent\u201d with\nERISA).\n   For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority\u2019s contrary determination.\n\f18               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n              AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                    B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n                  The \u201cPhantom Account\u201d \n\n   This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative\nexample of, as I understand it, how the \u201cphantom account\u201d\nworks. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the\nfollowing assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years\nfrom 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from\nXerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of\n$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he\nworked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until\nDecember 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second\nterm of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox\u2019s con\u00ad\ntribution to John\u2019s investment account was $2,500 in 1989\n(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox\u2019s\ncontributions to John\u2019s cash and investment accounts are\nalways made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of\nreturn in John\u2019s cash and investment accounts is always 5\npercent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.\n(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe\u00ad\ntuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the\nannuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay\u00ad\nment/Annuity Rate.)\n   Given the above assumptions, John\u2019s pension upon his\nretirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4 per\u00ad\ncent \u00d7 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000\n($10,500/5 percent). John\u2019s cash and investment accounts\nat the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While\nXerox\u2019s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until\n1990, each employee\u2019s opening cash account balance was\ncredited with the balance of his investment account at the\nend of 1989. The figures for John\u2019s cash account in 1989\nthus reflect the performance of his investment account. In\naddition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun\u00ad\ndred):\n\f                        Cite as: 559 U.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator\nwould assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu\u00ad\nlating John\u2019s pension. The Plan Administrator would also\nassume, when calculating the value of John\u2019s cash and\ninvestment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John\nhad received from Xerox had remained invested in his\naccounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would\ninclude the \u201cphantom account\u201d in his calculations. The\ntotal value of this phantom account in 1989, when John\nrejoined Xerox, is equal to John\u2019s lump-sum distribution of\n$140,000 \u00d7 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)\n   The Plan Administrator would thus compare John\u2019s\npension, column D, and column H to determine John\u2019s\nbenefit. As you can see above, column H provides the\ngreatest benefit, so John\u2019s cash account would be used to\ncalculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.\n   Second, the Plan Administrator would \u201coffset\u201d John\u2019s\nprior distribution against his current benefits to deter\u00ad\nmine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.\nThus, the Plan Administrator would take the \u201ctotal\u201d value\nof John\u2019s cash account, including the \u201cphantom account\u201d\n($277,800), and subtract out the value of the \u201cphantom\n\f20              CONKRIGHT v.

The total present value of the bene\u00ad\nfits John would receive upon his second retirement would\nthus be $13,800.\n   This means that John would receive approximately $690\nannually ($13,800 \u00d7 5 percent) upon retirement under the\nPlan Administrator\u2019s \u201cphantom account\u201d approach. In\ncomparison, if John had simply been treated as a new\nemployee when he was rehired, his pension would have\nentitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 \u00d7 1.4\npercent \u00d7 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of\nthe \u201cphantom account\u201d may have been even more dramatic\nwith respect to some of the respondents in this case. See\nBrief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul\nFrommert erroneously received a report claiming that his\nretirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later\ndiscovering that, because of the \u201cphantom account,\u201d his\nactual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also\nApp. 63a.\n\f"}
