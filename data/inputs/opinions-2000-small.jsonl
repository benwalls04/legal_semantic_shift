Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided March 31, 2010\nAfter respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New\n  York law on petitioner Shady Grove\u2019s insurance claim, Shady Grove\n  filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it\n  and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal\n  Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of\n  jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), which precludes a\n  class action to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d such as statutory interest. Affirm\n  ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in\n  compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, would\n  control if it conflicted with \u00a7901(b), but held there was no conflict be\n  cause \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 address different issues\u2014eligibility of the\n  particular type of claim for class treatment and certifiability of a\n  given class, respectively. Finding no Federal Rule on point, the Court\n  of Appeals held that \u00a7901(b) must be applied by federal courts sitting\n  in diversity because it is \u201csubstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R.\n  Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n549 F. 3d 137, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  PARTS I and II\u2013A, concluding that \u00a7901(b) does not preclude a federal\n  district court sitting in diversity from entertaining a class action un\n  der Rule 23.

CO.\n                            Syllabus\n\n       (b) Rule 23(b) answers the question in dispute\u2014whether Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit may proceed as a class action\u2014when it states that \u201c[a]\n    class action may be maintained\u201d if certain conditions are met. Since\n    \u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady\n    Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as a class action\u201d because of the\n    relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless\n    Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit\u2019s view that \u00a7901(b) and\n    Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil\n    ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23\n    explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case\n    meeting its criteria. Allstate\u2019s arguments based on the exclusion of\n    some federal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach pursuant to federal statutes\n    and on \u00a7901\u2019s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (c) The dissent\u2019s claim that \u00a7901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be\n    cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is\n    foreclosed by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.\n    The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to\n    avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), does\n    not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent\u2019s approach does not\n    avoid a conflict between \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren\n    der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II\u2013B and II\u2013D:\n       (a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, not Erie, controls\n    the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)\u2019s re\n    quirement that federal procedural rules \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or mod\n    ify any substantive right\u201d means that a Rule must \u201creally regulat[e]\n    procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec\n    ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and\n    redress for disregard or infraction of them,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson & Co.,\n    312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party\u2019s\n    rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing\n    those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,\n    or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that\n    criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\n    separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate\u2019s arguments\n    asserting \u00a7901(b)\u2019s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the\n    substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat\n    ters, but that of the Federal Rule. See, e.g., id., at 14. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (b) Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in\n    state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable re\n    sult of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress cre\n    ated.

S., at 13\u201314. Pp. 16\u201322.\n     JUSTICE STEVENS agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\n  must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and\n  it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case. Pp. 1\u201322.\n            (a) When the application of a federal rule would \u201cabridge,\n  enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072(b), the\n  federal rule cannot govern. In rare cases, a federal rule that dictates\n  an answer to a traditionally procedural question could, if applied,\n  displace an unusual state law that is procedural in the ordinary use\n  of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it\n  functions to define the scope of the state-created right. Examples\n  may include state laws that make it significantly more difficult to\n  bring or to prove a claim or that function as limits on the amount of\n  recovery. An application of a federal rule that directly collides with\n  such a state law violates the Rules Enabling Act. Pp. 1\u201313.\n            (b) N. Y. Civ. Prac.

A., provided medical care\nto Sonia E. Galvez for injuries she suffered in an automo\u00ad\nbile accident. As partial payment for that care, Galvez\nassigned to Shady Grove her rights to insurance benefits\nunder a policy issued in New York by Allstate Insurance\nCo. Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene\u00ad\nfits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to\npay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a)\n(West 2009). Allstate apparently paid, but not on time,\nand it refused to pay the statutory interest that accrued on\nthe overdue benefits (at two percent per month), see ibid.\n   Shady Grove filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York to recover the unpaid statutory in\u00ad\nterest.

The District Court dismissed the suit for\nlack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It rea\u00ad\nsoned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7901(b), which pre\u00ad\ncludes a suit to recover a \u201cpenalty\u201d from proceeding as a\nclass action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,\ndespite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding\nthat statutory interest is a \u201cpenalty\u201d under New York law,\nit held that \u00a7901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.\nAnd, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim\n(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in\u00ad\ncontroversy requirement for individual suits under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The\ncourt did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com\u00ad\npliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072,\nwould control if it conflicted with \u00a7901(b). But there was\nno conflict because (as we will describe in more detail\nbelow) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and\n\u00a7901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule\non point, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7901(b) is \u201csub\u00ad\nstantive\u201d within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U.

If it does, it governs\u2014New York\u2019s law not\u00ad\nwithstanding\u2014unless it exceeds statutory authorization or\nCongress\u2019s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.\nPlumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463\u2013464 (1965). We do not wade\ninto Erie\u2019s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli\u00ad\ncable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469\u2013471.\n                              A\n   The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove\u2019s suit\nmay proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an\u00ad\nswer. It states that \u201c[a] class action may be maintained\u201d if\ntwo conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria\nset forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also\nmust fit into one of the three categories described in sub\u00ad\ndivision (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this\ncreates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit\nmeets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class\naction. (The Federal Rules regularly use \u201cmay\u201d to confer\ncategorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n8(d)(2)\u2013(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)\u2013(b), 20(a)(1)\u2013(2), 27(a)(1),\n30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural\nentitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all\nformula for deciding the class-action question. Because\n\u00a7901(b) attempts to answer the same question\u2014i.e., it\nstates that Shady Grove\u2019s suit \u201cmay not be maintained as\na class action\u201d (emphasis added) because of the relief it\nseeks\u2014it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is\nultra vires.\n   The Second Circuit believed that \u00a7901(b) and Rule 23 do\nnot conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,\nit said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether\na given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on\nthe other hand, addresses an antecedent question:\nwhether the particular type of claim is eligible for class\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

See 549 F. 3d, at 143\u2013144. Allstate embraces\nthis analysis. Brief for Respondent 12\u201313.\n   We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility\nand certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi\u00ad\ntions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that\neligibility must depend on the \u201cparticular cause of action\u201d\nasserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at\n12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro\u00ad\nvide that only claims involving more than a certain num\u00ad\nber of plaintiffs are \u201celigible\u201d for class treatment in federal\ncourt. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)\u2019s prerequi\u00ad\nsites \u201celigibility criteria\u201d would obviate Allstate\u2019s objec\u00ad\ntion\u2014a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc\u00ad\ntion is made-to-order.\n   There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as\naddressing only whether claims made eligible for class\ntreatment by some other law should be certified as class\nactions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly\nnor implicitly empowers a federal court \u201cto certify a class\nin each and every case\u201d where the Rule\u2019s criteria are met.\nId., at 13\u201314. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It\nsays that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied \u201c[a]\nclass action may be maintained\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014not \u201ca\nclass action may be permitted.\u201d Courts do not maintain\nactions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23\u2019s\n\u201cmay\u201d is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring\nhis claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati\ncally applies \u201cin all civil actions and proceedings in the\nUnited States district courts,\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699\u2013700 (1979).\n   Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some\nfederal claims from Rule 23\u2019s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(e)(1)(B)\u2014which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule\n23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but\n\f6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                   Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n                              the Court\n\nrather leaves room for laws like \u00a7901(b). But Congress,\nunlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an\nindividual rule as it sees fit\u2014either by directly amending\nthe rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in\ncertain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517\nU. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created\nspecific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule\ndoes not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If\nRule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,\nthe statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.\n  Allstate next suggests that the structure of \u00a7901 shows\nthat Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),\nit notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly\nanalogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that\nsubsection is pre-empted). But \u00a7901(b)\u2019s rule barring class\nactions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,\nand where it applies \u00a7901(a) does not. This shows, accord\u00ad\ning to Allstate, that \u00a7901(b) concerns a separate subject.\nPerhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub\u00ad\nject of \u00a7901(a). But the question before us is whether it\nconcerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23\u2014\nand for purposes of answering that question the way New\nYork has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23\npermits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a\nState cannot limit that permission by structuring one part\nof its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part\nthat imposes additional requirements. Both of \u00a7901\u2019s\nsubsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule\n23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.\nCf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7\u20138.\n  The dissent argues that \u00a7901(b) has nothing to do with\nwhether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class\naction, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.\nSee post, at 8\u201317 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.).

Accordingly, the dissent says,\nRule 23 and New York\u2019s law may coexist in peace.\n   We need not decide whether a state law that limits the\nremedies available in an existing class action would con\u00ad\nflict with Rule 23; that is not what \u00a7901(b) does. By its\nterms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from \u201cmain\u00ad\ntain[ing]\u201d a class action seeking statutory penalties.\nUnlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other\nremedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,\n\u00a7901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may\naward; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming\ninto existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by\n\u00a7901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu\u00ad\ntory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in\nadvance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the\nevent the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the\nstatute\u2019s clear prohibition on \u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d such suits as\nclass actions.\n   The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid \u00a7901(b)\u2019s\nbarrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a\nrequest for statutory penalties. See post, at 14\u201315. Even\nassuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, post, at 13, we express no view\n\nas to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a\nsingle suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.\nWhether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, \u00a7901(b) does conflict\nbecause it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main\u00ad\ntain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal\nstatutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. \u00a72605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. \u00a71640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71854(c)(1). But Congress has plenary power to override the Federal\nRules, so its enactments, unlike those of the States, prevail even in case\nof a conflict.\n   5 But see, e.g., Asher v. Abbott Labs., 290 App. Div. 2d 208, 737\n\f8        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS.

If the state law instead banned class\nactions for fraud claims, a would-be class-action plaintiff\ncould drop the fraud counts from his complaint and pro\u00ad\nceed with the remainder in a class action. Yet that would\nnot mean the law provides no remedy for fraud; the ban\nwould affect only the procedural means by which the\nremedy may be pursued. In short, although the dissent\ncorrectly abandons Allstate\u2019s eligibility-certifiability dis\u00ad\ntinction, the alternative it offers fares no better.\n  The dissent all but admits that the literal terms of\n\u00a7901(b) address the same subject as Rule 23\u2014i.e., whether\na class action may be maintained\u2014but insists the provi\u00ad\nsion\u2019s purpose is to restrict only remedies. See post, at 12\u2013\n15; post, at 15 (\u201c[W]hile phrased as responsive to the\nquestion whether certain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b)\nis unmistakably aimed at controlling how those actions\nmust end\u201d). Unlike Rule 23, designed to further proce\u00ad\ndural fairness and efficiency, \u00a7901(b) (we are told) \u201cre\u00ad\nsponds to an entirely different concern\u201d: the fear that\nallowing statutory damages to be awarded on a class-wide\nbasis would \u201cproduce overkill.\u201d Post, at 12, 9 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The dissent reaches this con\u00ad\nclusion on the basis of (1) constituent concern recorded in\nthe law\u2019s bill jacket; (2) a commentary suggesting that the\nLegislature \u201capparently fear[ed]\u201d that combining class\nactions and statutory penalties \u201ccould result in annihilat\u00ad\ning punishment of the defendant,\u201d V.

But even accepting the dissent\u2019s account of\nthe Legislature\u2019s objective at face value, it cannot override\nthe statute\u2019s clear text. Even if its aim is to restrict the\nremedy a plaintiff can obtain, \u00a7901(b) achieves that end by\nlimiting a plaintiff\u2019s power to maintain a class action. The\nmanner in which the law \u201ccould have been written,\u201d post,\nat 23, has no bearing; what matters is the law the Legisla\u00ad\nture did enact. We cannot rewrite that to reflect our\nperception of legislative purpose, see Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380 (1998).6 The\ndissent\u2019s concern for state prerogatives is frustrated\nrather than furthered by revising state laws when a po\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Our  decision in Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740 (1980),\ndiscussed by the dissent, post, at 5\u20136, 13\u201314, n. 8, is not to the contrary.\nThere we held that Rule 3 (which provides that a federal civil action is\n\u201c \u2018commenced\u2019 \u201d by filing a complaint in federal court) did not displace a\nstate law providing that \u201c \u2018[a]n action shall be deemed commenced,\nwithin the meaning of this article [the statute of limitations], as to each\ndefendant, at the date of the summons which is served on him . . . .\u2019 \u201d\n446 U. S., at 743, n. 4 (quoting Okla. Stat., Tit. 12, \u00a797 (1971); altera\u00ad\ntion in original, emphasis added). Rule 3, we explained, \u201cgoverns the\ndate from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules\nbegin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations\u201d or tolling\nrules, which it did not \u201cpurpor[t] to displace.\u201d 446 U. S., at 751, 750.\nThe texts were therefore not in conflict. While our opinion observed\nthat the State\u2019s actual-service rule was (in the State\u2019s judgment) an\n\u201cintegral part of the several policies served by the statute of limita\u00ad\ntions,\u201d id., at 751, nothing in our decision suggested that a federal court\nmay resolve an obvious conflict between the texts of state and federal\nrules by resorting to the state law\u2019s ostensible objectives.\n\f10     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Wilson\n& Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941). It would mean, to begin\nwith, that one State\u2019s statute could survive pre-emption\n(and accordingly affect the procedures in federal court)\nwhile another State\u2019s identical law would not, merely\nbecause its authors had different aspirations. It would\nalso mean that district courts would have to discern, in\nevery diversity case, the purpose behind any putatively\npre-empted state procedural rule, even if its text squarely\nconflicts with federal law. That task will often prove\narduous. Many laws further more than one aim, and the\naim of others may be impossible to discern. Moreover, to\nthe extent the dissent\u2019s purpose-driven approach depends\non its characterization of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s aims as substantive, it\nwould apply to many state rules ostensibly addressed to\nprocedure. Pleading standards, for example, often embody\npolicy preferences about the types of claims that should\nsucceed\u2014as do rules governing summary judgment, pre\u00ad\ntrial discovery, and the admissibility of certain evidence.\nHard cases will abound. It is not even clear that a state\nsupreme court\u2019s pronouncement of the law\u2019s purpose\nwould settle the issue, since existence of the factual predi\u00ad\ncate for avoiding federal pre-emption is ultimately a fed\u00ad\neral question. Predictably, federal judges would be con\u00ad\ndemned to poring through state legislative history\u2014which\nmay be less easily obtained, less thorough, and less famil\u00ad\niar than its federal counterpart, see R. Mersky & D. Dunn,\nFundamentals of Legal Research 233 (8th ed. 2002); Tor\u00ad\nres & Windsor, State Legislative Histories: A Select, An\u00ad\nnotated Bibliography, 85 L. Lib.

The central difficulty is that even artificial\nnarrowing cannot render \u00a7901(b) compatible with Rule 23.\nWhatever the policies they pursue, they flatly contradict\neach other. Allstate asserts (and the dissent implies, see\npost, at 3, 11) that we can (and must) interpret Rule 23 in\na manner that avoids overstepping its authorizing stat\u00ad\nute.7 If the Rule were susceptible of two meanings\u2014one\nthat would violate \u00a72072(b) and another that would not\u2014\nwe would agree.

But it is not.\nRule 23 unambiguously authorizes any plaintiff, in any\nfederal civil proceeding, to maintain a class action if the\nRule\u2019s prerequisites are met. We cannot contort its text,\neven to avert a collision with state law that might render\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The    dissent also suggests that we should read the Federal Rules\n\u201c \u2018with sensitivity to important state interests\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018to avoid conflict\nwith important state regulatory policies.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 7 (quoting Gasperini\nv.

The search for state interests and policies that are \u201cimportant\u201d\nis just as standardless as the \u201cimportant or substantial\u201d criterion we\nrejected in Sibbach v.

S. 740,\n750, n. 9 (1980).8 What the dissent\u2019s approach achieves is\nnot the avoiding of a \u201cconflict between Rule 23 and\n\u00a7901(b),\u201d post, at 17, but rather the invalidation of Rule 23\n(pursuant to \u00a72072(b) of the Rules Enabling Act) to the\nextent that it conflicts with the substantive policies of\n\u00a7901. There is no other way to reach the dissent\u2019s destina\u00ad\ntion. We must therefore confront head-on whether Rule\n23 falls within the statutory authorization.\n                               B\n   Erie involved the constitutional power of federal courts\nto supplant state law with judge-made rules.

York, 326 U. S. 99, 109 (1945). That\nis not the test for either the constitutionality or the statu\u00ad\ntory validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Congress has\nundoubted power to supplant state law, and undoubted\npower to prescribe rules for the courts it has created, so\nlong as those rules regulate matters \u201crationally capable of\nclassification\u201d as procedure. Hanna, 380 U. S., at 472. In\nthe Rules Enabling Act, Congress authorized this Court to\npromulgate rules of procedure subject to its review, 28\nU. S.

We\nhave found to be in compliance with \u00a72072(b) rules pre\u00ad\nscribing methods for serving process, see id., at 445\u2013446\n(Fed. Rule Civ.

Likewise, we have upheld rules au\u00ad\nthorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file\nfrivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed.

Each\nof these rules had some practical effect on the parties\u2019\nrights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for\nenforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,\nthe available remedies, or the rules of decision by which\nthe court adjudicated either.\n   Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules\nallowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi\u00ad\n\f14      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder\nof parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules\nneither change plaintiffs\u2019 separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants\u2019 rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23\u2014at\nleast insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their\nseparate claims against the same defendants in a class\naction\u2014falls within \u00a72072(b)\u2019s authorization. A class\naction, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a\nspecies), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate\nclaims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate\nsuits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties\u2019\nlegal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision\nunchanged.\n   Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions\nis not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue\non behalf of a class \u201ctransform[s] [the] dispute over a five\nhundred dollar penalty into a dispute over a five million\ndollar penalty.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate\u2019s aggre\u00ad\ngate liability, however, does not depend on whether the\nsuit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus\nmembers of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl\u00ad\nedges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual\nclaim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who\nwould not bring individual suits for the relatively small\nsums involved will choose to join a class action. That has\nno bearing, however, on Allstate\u2019s or the plaintiffs\u2019 legal\nrights.

To\nbegin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of\n\u00a7901(b) (which is to be found in New York\u2019s procedural\ncode) confines it to claims under New York law; and of\ncourse New York has no power to alter substantive rights\nand duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,\nthe consequence of excluding certain class actions may be\nto cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,\nbut the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,\n\u00a7901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple\njoinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even\nif \u00a7901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted \u201cfor\nsubstantive reasons,\u201d id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end\nwas not to improve \u201cthe conduct of the litigation process\nitself\u201d but to alter \u201cthe outcome of that process.\u201d Id., at 26.\n   The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is\nthat the substantive nature of New York\u2019s law, or its\nsubstantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule\nof Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid\nin others\u2014or valid in some cases and invalid in others\u2014\ndepending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state\nsubstantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for\nsubstantive purposes). That could not be clearer in\nSibbach:\n    \u201cThe petitioner says the phrase [\u2018substantive rights\u2019 in\n    the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use\n    Congress intended that in regulating procedure this\n    Court should not deal with important and substantial\n    rights theretofore recognized. Recognized where and\n    by whom? The state courts are divided as to the\n    power in the absence of statute to order a physical ex\u00ad\n    amination. In a number such an order is authorized\n    by statute or rule. . . .\n      \u201cThe asserted right, moreover, is no more important\n\f16      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If we were to\n     adopt the suggested criterion of the importance of the\n     alleged right we should invite endless litigation and\n     confusion worse confounded.

S., at 13\u201314 (footnotes omitted).\nHanna unmistakably expressed the same understanding\nthat compliance of a Federal Rule with the Enabling Act is\nto be assessed by consulting the Rule itself, and not its\neffects in individual applications:\n     \u201c[T]he court has been instructed to apply the Federal\n     Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory\n     Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their\n     prima facie judgment that the Rule in question trans\u00ad\n     gresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor con\u00ad\n     stitutional restrictions.\u201d 380 U. S., at 471.\n   In sum, it is not the substantive or procedural nature or\npurpose of the affected state law that matters, but the\nsubstantive or procedural nature of the Federal Rule. We\nhave held since Sibbach, and reaffirmed repeatedly, that\nthe validity of a Federal Rule depends entirely upon\nwhether it regulates procedure. See Sibbach, supra, at 14;\nHanna, supra, at 464; Burlington, 480 U. S., at 8. If it\ndoes, it is authorized by \u00a72072 and is valid in all jurisdic\u00ad\ntions, with respect to all claims, regardless of its incidental\neffect upon state-created rights.\n                           C\n  A few words in response to the concurrence.

Post, at\n5\u20137 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The concurrence agrees with us that Rule 23\nand \u00a7901(b) conflict, post, at 15\u201316, and departs from us\nonly with respect to the second part of the test, i.e.,\nwhether application of the Federal Rule violates \u00a72072(b),\npost, at 7\u201313. Like us, it answers no, but for a reason\ndifferent from ours. Post, at 17\u201322.\n  The concurrence would decide this case on the basis, not\nthat Rule 23 is procedural, but that the state law it dis\u00ad\nplaces is procedural, in the sense that it does not \u201cfunction\nas a part of the State\u2019s definition of substantive rights and\nremedies.\u201d Post, at 1. A state procedural rule is not pre\u00ad\nempted, according to the concurrence, so long\nas it is \u201cso bound up with,\u201d or \u201csufficiently intertwined\nwith,\u201d a substantive state-law right or remedy \u201cthat it\ndefines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,\u201d\npost, at 4, 13.\n  This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which\nestablished the rule we apply. The concurrence contends\nthat Sibbach did not rule out its approach, but that is not\nso. Recognizing the impracticability of a test that turns on\nthe idiosyncrasies of state law, Sibbach adopted and ap\u00ad\nplied a rule with a single criterion: whether the Federal\nRule \u201creally regulates procedure.\u201d 312 U. S., at 14.9 That\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The concurrence claims that in Sibbach \u201c[t]he Court . . . had no oc\u00ad\n\ncasion to consider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.\u201d Post, at 12. Had\nSibbach been applying the concurrence\u2019s theory, that is quite true\u2014\nwhich demonstrates how inconsistent that theory is with Sibbach. For\nconformity with the Rules Enabling Act was the very issue Sibbach\ndecided: The petitioner\u2019s position was that Rules 35 and 37 exceeded\nthe Enabling Act\u2019s authorization, 312 U. S., at 9, 13; the Court faced\nand rejected that argument, id., at 13\u201316, and proceeded to reverse\nthe lower court for failing to apply Rule 37 correctly, id., at 16. There\n\f18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthe concurrence\u2019s approach would have yielded the same\nresult in Sibbach proves nothing; what matters is the rule\nwe did apply, and that rule leaves no room for special\nexemptions based on the function or purpose of a particu\u00ad\nlar state rule.10 We have rejected an attempt to read into\nSibbach an exception with no basis in the opinion, see\nSchlagenhauf, 379 U. S., at 113\u2013114, and we see no reason\nto find such an implied limitation today.\n  In reality, the concurrence seeks not to apply Sibbach,\nbut to overrule it (or, what is the same, to rewrite it). Its\napproach, the concurrence insists, gives short shrift to the\nstatutory text forbidding the Federal Rules from\n\u201cabridg[ing], enlarg[ing], or modify[ing] any substantive\nright,\u201d \u00a72072(b). See post, at 9\u201310. There is something to\nthat. It is possible to understand how it can be deter\u00ad\nmined whether a Federal Rule \u201cenlarges\u201d substantive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncould not be a clearer rejection of the theory that the concurrence now\nadvocates.\n  The concurrence responds that the \u201cthe specific question of \u2018the\nobligation of federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state\u2019 \u201d was\nnot before the Court, post, at 12 (quoting Sibbach, supra, at 9). It is\nclear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie\nprohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion\nunquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules\u2019 compliance with \u00a72072(b),\nand it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,\nwhich does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule\nabridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13\u201314. To the\nextent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules\u2019 validity vis-\u00e0-vis\ncontrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U. S., at 472, and it made\nclear that Sibbach\u2019s test still controls, see 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465,\n470\u2013471.\n  10 The concurrence insists that we have misread Sibbach, since surely\n\na Federal Rule that \u201cin most cases\u201d regulates procedure does not do so\nwhen it displaces one of those \u201crare\u201d state substantive laws that are\ndisguised as rules of procedure. Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what\nthe Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex\u00ad\nplained, supra, at 12\u201313, most Rules have some effect on litigants\u2019\nsubstantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not\nmean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

But it is\nhard to understand how it can be determined whether a\nFederal Rule \u201cabridges\u201d or \u201cmodifies\u201d substantive rights\nwithout knowing what state-created rights would obtain if\nthe Federal Rule did not exist. Sibbach\u2019s exclusive focus\non the challenged Federal Rule\u2014driven by the very real\nconcern that Federal Rules which vary from State to State\nwould be chaos, see 312 U. S., at 13\u201314\u2014is hard to square\nwith \u00a72072(b)\u2019s terms.11\n  Sibbach has been settled law, however, for nearly seven\ndecades.12 Setting aside any precedent requires a \u201cspecial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The concurrence\u2019s approach, however, is itself unfaithful to the\n\nstatute\u2019s terms. Section 2072(b) bans abridgement or modification only\nof \u201csubstantive rights,\u201d but the concurrence would prohibit pre-emption\nof \u201cprocedural rules that are intimately bound up in the scope of a\nsubstantive right or remedy,\u201d post, at 19. This would allow States to\nforce a wide array of parochial procedures on federal courts so long as\nthey are \u201csufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy.\u201d Post,\nat 13.\n   12 The concurrence implies that Sibbach has slipped into desuetude,\n\napparently for lack of sufficient citations. See post, at 13\u201314, n. 14. We\nare unaware of any rule to the effect that a holding of ours expires if\nthe case setting it forth is not periodically revalidated. In any event,\nthe concurrence\u2019s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag\u00ad\ngerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as\nestablishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464\u2013465, 470\u2013471.\nMississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445\u2013446\n(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the\nFederal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern\nR. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business\nGuides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.\n533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna\u2014\nwhich as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.\nSee Burlington Northern, supra, at 5\u20136, 8; Business Guides, supra, at\n552\u2013554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the\nU. S. Reports, its rule\u2014and in particular its focus on the Federal Rule\nas the proper unit of analysis\u2014is alive and well.\n   In contrast, Hanna\u2019s obscure obiter dictum that a court \u201cneed not\n\f20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

And a party\nseeking to overturn a statutory precedent bears an even\ngreater burden, since Congress remains free to correct us,\nibid., and adhering to our precedent enables it do so, see,\ne.g., Finley v.

We do Congress no service\nby presenting it a moving target. In all events, Allstate\nhas not even asked us to overrule Sibbach, let alone car\u00ad\nried its burden of persuading us to do so. Cf. IBP, Inc. v.\nAlvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32 (2005). Why we should cast\naside our decades-old decision escapes us, especially since\n(as the concurrence explains) that would not affect the\nresult.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nwholly blind itself\u201d to a Federal Rule\u2019s effect on a case\u2019s outcome, 380 \n\nU.

Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach\u2019s\nstraightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for\nthat statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency\nbetween the two.\n   13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi\u00ad\n\ntion any rule that \u201creally regulates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, supra, at 14,\nwill pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however \u201cbound up\u201d the latter is\nwith substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that\nresult proves our interpretation of \u00a72072(b) implausible, post, at 10,\nn. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term \u201csubstantive\nrights\u201d in \u00a72072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but\nalso any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the\ntext nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The\nexamples the concurrence offers\u2014statutes of limitations, burdens of\nproof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards\u2014do not\nmake its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They\nmerely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine\nwhether a rule \u201creally regulates\u201d procedure or substance. If one con\u00ad\ncludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal\nRule itself is invalid.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

See post, at 11, n. 10.\nUndoubtedly some hard cases will arise (though we have\nmanaged to muddle through well enough in the 69 years\nsince Sibbach was decided). But as the concurrence ac\u00ad\nknowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:\nThe statute itself refers to \u201csubstantive right[s],\u201d \u00a72072(b),\nso there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc\u00ad\ntion. What is more, the concurrence\u2019s approach does\nnothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it\nmany times over. Instead of a single hard question of\nwhether a Federal Rule regulates substance or procedure,\nthat approach will present hundreds of hard questions,\nforcing federal courts to assess the substantive or proce\u00ad\ndural character of countless state rules that may conflict\nwith a single Federal Rule.14 And it still does not sidestep\nthe problem it seeks to avoid. At the end of the day, one\nmust come face to face with the decision whether or not\nthe state policy (with which a putatively procedural state\nrule may be \u201cbound up\u201d) pertains to a \u201csubstantive right or\nremedy,\u201d post, at 19\u2014that is, whether it is substance or\nprocedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  The concurrence\u2019s concern would make more sense if many Federal\nRules that effectively alter state-law rights \u201cbound up with procedures\u201d\nwould survive under Sibbach. But as the concurrence concedes, post, at\n11, n. 10, very few would do so. The possible existence of a few outlier\ninstances does not prove Sibbach\u2019s interpretation is absurd. Congress\nmay well have accepted such anomalies as the price of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure.\n  14 The concurrence argues that its approach is no more \u201ctaxing\u201d than\n\nours because few if any Federal Rules that are \u201cfacially valid\u201d under the\nEnabling Act will fail the concurrence\u2019s test. Post, at 11, and n. 10. But\nthat conclusion will be reached only after federal courts have consid\u00ad\nered hundreds of state rules applying the concurrence\u2019s inscrutable\nstandard.\n  15 The concurrence insists that the task will be easier if courts can\n\f22       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

That is unaccept\u00ad\nable when it comes as the consequence of judge-made rules\ncreated to fill supposed \u201cgaps\u201d in positive federal law. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 471\u2013472. For where neither the Con\u00ad\nstitution, a treaty, nor a statute provides the rule of deci\u00ad\nsion or authorizes a federal court to supply one, \u201cstate law\nmust govern because there can be no other law.\u201d Ibid.; see\nClark, Erie\u2019s Constitutional Source, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 1289,\n1302, 1311 (2007). But divergence from state law, with the\nattendant consequence of forum shopping, is the inevitable\n(indeed, one might say the intended) result of a uniform\nsystem of federal procedure. Congress itself has created the\npossibility that the same case may follow a different course\nif filed in federal instead of state court. Cf. Hanna, 380\nU. S., at 472\u2013473. The short of the matter is that a Federal\nRule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters\nthe outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shop\u00ad\nping. To hold otherwise would be to \u201cdisembowel either the\nConstitution\u2019s grant of power over federal procedure\u201d or\nCongress\u2019s exercise of it.

C. \u00a72072.\n   That does not mean, however, that the federal rule\nalways governs. Congress has provided for a system of\nuniform federal rules, see ibid., under which federal courts\nsitting in diversity operate as \u201can independent system for\nadministering justice to litigants who properly invoke its\njurisdiction,\u201d Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,\nInc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), and not as state-court\nclones that assume all aspects of state tribunals but are\nmanaged by Article III judges. See Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n473\u2013474. But while Congress may have the constitutional\npower to prescribe procedural rules that interfere with\nstate substantive law in any number of respects, that is\nnot what Congress has done. Instead, it has provided in\nthe Enabling Act that although \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u201d\nmay \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and procedure,\u201d\n\u00a72072(a), those rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b). Therefore, \u201c[w]hen a\nsituation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, . . . the\ncourt has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule\u201d\nunless doing so would violate the Act or the Constitution.\nHanna, 380 U.

Ibid.; see also id., at 469\u2013470. The\nEnabling Act does not invite federal courts to engage in\nthe \u201crelatively unguided Erie choice,\u201d id., at 471, but\ninstead instructs only that federal rules cannot \u201cabridge,\nenlarge or modify any substantive right,\u201d \u00a72072(b). The\nEnabling Act\u2019s limitation does not mean that federal rules\ncannot displace state policy judgments; it means only that\nfederal rules cannot displace a State\u2019s definition of its own\nrights or remedies. See Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S.\n1, 13\u201314 (1941) (reasoning that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantive\nrights\u2019 \u201d embraces only those state rights that are sought\nto be enforced in the judicial proceedings).\n   Congress has thus struck a balance: \u201c[H]ousekeeping\nrules for federal courts\u201d will generally apply in diversity\ncases, notwithstanding that some federal rules \u201cwill inevi\ntably differ\u201d from state rules.

And were federal\ncourts to ignore those portions of substantive state law\nthat operate as procedural devices, it could in many in\nstances limit the ways that sovereign States may define\ntheir rights and remedies. When a State chooses to use a\ntraditionally procedural vehicle as a means of defining the\nscope of substantive rights or remedies, federal courts\nmust recognize and respect that choice. Cf.

At both steps\nof the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the\nstate law and the federal rule mean.\n   The court must first determine whether the scope of the\nfederal rule is \u201c \u2018sufficiently broad\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018control the issue\u2019 \u201d\nbefore the court, \u201cthereby leaving no room for the opera\ntion\u201d of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington\nNorthern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4\u20135 (1987); Walker\nv. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749\u2013750, and n. 9\n(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate\nalongside the state rule, then there is no \u201cAc[t] of Con\ngress\u201d governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules\nof Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In\nsome instances, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a federal rule will\nnot come into \u201c \u2018direct collision\u2019 \u201d with the state law, and\nboth can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In\nother instances, the rule \u201cwhen fairly construed,\u201d Burling\nton Northern R. Co., 480 U.

Unlike JUSTICE\nSCALIA, I believe that an application of a federal rule that\neffectively abridges, enlarges, or modifies a state-created\nright or remedy violates this command. Congress may\nhave the constitutional power \u201cto supplant state law\u201d with\nrules that are \u201crationally capable of classification as pro\ncedure,\u201d ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbut we should generally presume that it has not done so.\nCf. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(observing that \u201cwe start with the assumption\u201d that a\nfederal statute does not displace a State\u2019s law \u201cunless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the mandate that\nfederal rules \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any\nsubstantive right\u201d evinces the opposite intent, as does\nCongress\u2019 decision to delegate the creation of rules to this\nCourt rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).\n  Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back\ninto the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,\nenlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must\nconsider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to\navoid that impermissible result.

JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s objection, more\nover, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears\nprocedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on\nappeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.\nA rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really\nbe a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress. A rule that a\nclaim must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt may really be a\ndefinition of the scope of the claim.

It also ig\nnores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright\n\u00a74509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555\nU.

Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the\nfederal rule would have altered the State\u2019s \u201csubstantive rights.\u201d\n   9 The plurality\u2019s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean\n\nthat no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State\u2019s own\nrights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate\n\u201cthe manner and the means by which the litigants\u2019 rights are enforced,\u201d\nante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are\nmany ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State\u2019s\nformulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,\nalthough in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a\ntemporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to\npromulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in\nsome instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi\nlarly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could\neviscerate a critical aspect\u2014albeit one that deals with how a right is\nenforced\u2014of a State\u2019s framework of rights and remedies.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed\neral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state\nlaw, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina\ntions about whether application of a given rule would\ndisplace a state determination about substantive rights.\nSee ante, at 15, 21\u201322, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an\nEnabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is\nmore taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s.10 But in any event,\nthat inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it\nmay not be easy to decide what is actually a \u201csubstantive\nright,\u201d \u201cthe designations substantive and procedural be\ncome important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.\u201d\nEly 723; see also Wright \u00a74509, at 266. The question,\ntherefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on\nfederal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab\nlished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer\neasily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does\nnot give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of\nthe Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cshall not\u201d alter \u201cany\u201d substantive right. \u00a72072(b).\n   10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28\n\nU. S. C. \u00a72072 will displace a State\u2019s definition of its own substantive\nrights. See Wright \u00a74509, at 272 (observing that \u201cunusual cases\noccasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state\nrule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state\nsubstantive rights\u201d). JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s interpretation, moreover, is not\nmuch more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts\u2019 having\nto evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal\nrule is really \u201cprocedural.\u201d It is hard to know the answer to that\nquestion and especially hard to resolve it without considering the\nnature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.\nThe plurality\u2019s \u201c \u2018test\u2019 is no test at all\u2014in a sense, it is little more than\nthe statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce\ndural.\u201d Id., \u00a74509, at 264.\n\f12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality\nmisreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in\nHanna, \u201cshorthand formulations which have appeared in\nearlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that\nfrequently arise from oversimplification.\u201d 380 U. S., at\n475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is\nfirst necessary to understand the issue that was before the\nCourt. The petitioner raised only the facial question\nwhether \u201cRules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this\ncourt\u201d and not the specific question of \u201cthe obligation of\nfederal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.\u201d11\n312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to\nconsider whether the particular application of the Federal\nRules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not\n\nvalidly address subjects involving \u201cimportant questions of policy,\u201d Supp.\nBrief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of\nRespondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner\nargued only that \u201c[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical\nexamination\u201d is \u201ca \u2018substantive\u2019 right forbidden by Congress\u201d to be\naddressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201ceven though in\ntheory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation\u201d).

Ante, at 15\u201316. But the quoted passage of\nSibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may\n\u201cdeal with\u201d particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality\u2019s\nblock quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to\nthe resolution of the case because the matter at issue,\nrequiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to\n\u201csubstantive rights\u201d under the Enabling Act. Although\nmost state rules bearing on the litigation process are\nadopted for some policy reason, few seemingly \u201cproce\ndural\u201d rules define the scope of a substantive right or\nremedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet\ning federal and state judgments about privacy interests.\nThose privacy concerns may have been weighty and in\nsome sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the\nscope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga\ntion. Thus, in response to the petitioner\u2019s argument in\nSibbach that \u201csubstantive rights\u201d include not only \u201crights\nsought to be adjudicated by the litigants\u201d but also \u201cgeneral\nprinciple[s]\u201d or \u201cquestion[s] of public policy that the legis\nlature is able to pass upon,\u201d id., at 2\u20133, we held that \u201cthe\nphrase \u2018substantive rights\u2019 \u201d embraces only state rights,\nsuch as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be\nenforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13\u201314. If the\nFederal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was\nsufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then\nperhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ\nent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwhich the Court explained that the term \u201csubstantive rights\u201d in the\nEnabling Act \u201ccertainly embraces such rights\u201d as \u201crights conferred by\nlaw to be protected and enforced,\u201d such as \u201cthe right not to be injured in\none\u2019s person by another\u2019s negligence\u201d and \u201cto redress [such] infraction.\u201d\nIbid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right \u201cto\nredress [an] infraction,\u201d will depend on the state law that it displaces.\n   13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases \u201creally regu\n\nlates procedure,\u201d Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not \u201creally regulat[e]\nprocedure\u201d when it displaces those rare state rules that, although\n\u201cprocedural\u201d in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the\nrights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is\nprocedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).\n  14 Although this Court\u2019s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of\n\f14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n                             III\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG views the basic issue in this case as\nwhether and how to apply a federal rule that dictates an\nanswer to a traditionally procedural question (whether to\njoin plaintiffs together as a class), when a state law that\n\u201cdefines the dimensions\u201d of a state-created claim dictates\nthe opposite answer. Post, at 12. As explained above, I\nreadily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state\nrule that is \u201c \u2018procedural\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the\nterm,\u201d S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently\ninterwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem\nedy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the\nfederal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlittle significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural\nfederal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state\nright; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the\nCourt. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach\u2019s statement that the Ena\nbling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated\nby the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13\u201314, for the proposition that \u201ca court, in\nmeasuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the\nEnabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the\nRule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from\nthe course it would follow in state courts,\u201d 380 U. S., at 473. And most\nof our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame\nwork for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned\nSibbach at all but cited only Hanna. See, e.g., Burlington Northern R.\nCo. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 5 (1987).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA notes that in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v.\nMurphree, 326 U. S. 438 (1946), we used language that supported his\nview. See ante, at 13. But in that case, we contemplated only that the\nFederal Rule in question might have \u201cincidental effects . . . upon the\nrights of litigants,\u201d explaining that \u201c[t]he fact that the application of\nRule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner\u2019s rights to adjudication by\nthe district court for northern Mississippi\u201d rather than southern Mis\nsissippi \u201cwill undoubtedly affect those rights.\u201d 326 U. S., at 445\u2013446.\nThere was no suggestion that by affecting the method of enforcing the\nrights in that case, the federal rules could plausibly abridge, enlarge, or\nmodify the rights themselves.\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      15\n\n                          Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthis is not such a case.\nRule 23 Controls Class Certification\n  When the District Court in the case before us was asked\nto certify a class action, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23\nsquarely governed the determination whether the court\nshould do so. That is the explicit function of Rule 23. Rule\n23, therefore, must apply unless its application would\nabridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.\n  Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under\nstand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the\nquestion of class certification in this matter because New\nYork has made a substantive judgment that such a class\nshould not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.\nAlthough, as discussed infra, at 17\u201320, I do not accept the\ndissent\u2019s view of \u00a7901(b), I also do not see how the dis\nsent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent\u2019s premises that a class\n\ncannot be certified. The dissent contends that \u00a7901(b) is a damages\n\u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or \u201cproscription,\u201d post, at 12,\nn. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 \u201cdoes not command that a particular remedy\nbe available when a party sues in a representative capacity,\u201d post, at\n11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the\ndissent\u2019s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question\nwhether petitioner may certify a class, and \u00a7901(b) would be relevant\nonly to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action\nlawsuit, may collect statutory damages.\n   It may be that if the dissent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7901(b) were correct,\nthis class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the\nfederal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(6). But that\nissue was not raised in respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss (from which the\ncase comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the\nCourt. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has \u201cacknowledged\nthat its individual claim\u201d is for less than the required amount in\ncontroversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what\nactual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court\nwere to adopt all of the dissent\u2019s premises, I believe the correct disposi\ntion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of\nwhether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.\n\f16     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS.

But that is\nnot what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule\nshould be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not\nfollow that courts may rewrite the rule.\n   At bottom, the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Rule 23 seems\nto be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its\napplication would create no Erie problem. The dissent\nwould apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie\neven to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,\nand thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But\n\u201c[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,\nthe question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,\nrelatively unguided Erie choice.\u201d Hanna, 380 U. S., at\n471. The question is only whether the Enabling Act is\nsatisfied. Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro\ntect \u201cstate regulatory policies,\u201d post, at 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach would,\nin my view, work an end run around Congress\u2019 system of\nuniform federal rules, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072, and our deci\nsion in Hanna. Federal courts can and should interpret\nfederal rules with sensitivity to \u201cstate prerogatives,\u201d post,\nat 4; but even when \u201cstate interests . . . warrant our re\nspectful consideration,\u201d post, at 8, federal courts cannot\nrewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly\nthat \u00a7901(b) is substantive and that class certification\nshould be denied, then they should argue within the Ena\nbling Act\u2019s framework. Otherwise, \u201cthe Federal Rule\napplies regardless of contrary state law.\u201d Gasperini, 518\nU. S., at 427, n. 7; accord, Hanna, 380 U. S., at 471.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

This inquiry is not always a simple one because\n\u201c[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that\ncannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,\u201d\nWright \u00a74508, at 232\u2013233, and almost \u201cany rule can be\nsaid to have . . . \u2018substantive effects,\u2019 affecting society\u2019s\ndistribution of risks and rewards,\u201d Ely 724, n. 170. Faced\nwith a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition\nally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,\none can often argue that the state rule was really some\npart of the State\u2019s definition of its rights or remedies.\n   In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling\nAct problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law\nis designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a\njudgment about how state courts ought to operate and not\na judgment about the scope of state-created rights and\nremedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal\ncourt system, there are costs involved in attempting to\ndiscover the true nature of a state procedural rule and\nallowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule\nthat appears to govern the same question. The mere\npossibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created\nright is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.\n   The text of CPLR \u00a7901(b) expressly and unambiguously\napplies not only to claims based on New York law but also\nto claims based on federal law or the law of any other\nState. And there is no interpretation from New York\ncourts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how\n\u00a7901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce\ndural in form, serves the function of defining New York\u2019s\nrights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because\nlawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal\nclass actions well before New York passed \u00a7901(b) in 1975,\n\f18       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                   v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is\ntrue, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited\namount of legislative history that can be read to suggest\nthat the New York officials who supported \u00a7901(b) wished\nto create a \u201climitation\u201d on New York\u2019s \u201cstatutory dam\nages.\u201d Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is\nnot the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7\u20138\n(opinion of the Court).\n   The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de\nscribe a judgment that \u00a7901(b) would operate as a limita\ntion on New York\u2019s statutory damages. In evaluating that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns\n\ncreate laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws\nwill apply only within their territory. See post, at 18\u201320. That is a true\nfact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent\u2019s position. For\none thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if\nthere is no conflict between Rule 23 and \u00a7901(b), and the court can thus\napply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the\nonly question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,\n380 U. S., at 471.      And that inquiry is different from the Rules of\nDecision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469\u2013471.\n   The dissent\u2019s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter\npreting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that\nlaws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending\nupon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume\nthat \u201cthe character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined\nwholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,\u201d American\nBanana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the\ncontext of \u00a7901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes\nlittle sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing\nwhat people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed\nto the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.\nThus, \u00a7901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it\nstates that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New\nYork Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear\nclaims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims\nunder New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had\nwritten a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up\n\u00a7901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong\npresumption is to the contrary.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nlegislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between\nprocedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem\ningly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the\nscope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost\nevery rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect\non the outcome of litigation, not every state rule \u201cdefines\nthe dimensions of [a] claim itself,\u201d post, at 12. New York\nclearly crafted \u00a7901(b) with the intent that only certain\nlawsuits\u2014those for which there were not statutory penal\nties\u2014could be joined in class actions in New York courts.\nThat decision reflects a policy judgment about which\nlawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class\nform and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care\nfully outlines, see post, at 8\u201310, \u00a7901(b) was \u201capparently\u201d\nadopted in response to fears that the class-action proce\ndure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to \u201c annihi\nlating punishment of the defendant.\u201d V. Alexander, Prac\ntice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney\u2019s\nConsolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.\nCrompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,\n1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par\nticularly strong evidence that \u00a7901(b) serves to define who\ncan obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a\nclass would enlarge New York\u2019s remedy. Any device that\nmakes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to\nrecover damages.\n   In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some\nopponents of a broad class-action device \u201cargued that there\nwas no need to permit class actions in order to encourage\nlitigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an\naggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to\npursue a claim.\u201d Id., at 211, 863 N. E. 2d, at 1015 (em\nphasis added). But those opponents may have felt merely\nthat, for any number of reasons, New York courts should\nnot conduct trials in the class format when that format is\n\f20       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nunnecessary to motivate litigation.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG\nasserts that this could not be true because \u201csuits seeking\nstatutory damages are arguably best suited to the class\ndevice because individual proof of actual damages is un\nnecessary.\u201d Post, at 9\u201310. But some people believe that\nclass actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as\nthey join together slightly disparate claims or force courts\nto adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss\nthe possibility that New York legislators shared in those\nbeliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when\nit appeared to be unnecessary.\n   The legislative history of \u00a7901 thus reveals a classically\nprocedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims\nin New York courts (under any source of law) only when it\nis necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the\nclass tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula\ntion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for\nbriefs. There is of course a difference of degree between\nthose examples and class certification, but not a difference\nof kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical\neffect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but\nthat does not transform it into a damages \u201cproscription,\u201d\npost, at 12, n. 6, 21, or \u201climitation,\u201d post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,\n25.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature\n\nwould create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply\nonly when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a\nlawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to\nsee how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York\u2019s\npenalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or\nindividual, and that \u00a7901(b) addresses penalties that are created under\nany source of state or federal law.\n   18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter\n\nwould \u201ctransform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.\u201d Post, at 1. But\nin fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one\n$5,000,000 case. It may be that without class certification, not all of\nthe potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

If the applicable federal rule did not\ngovern the particular question at issue (or could be fairly\nread not to do so), then those considerations would matter,\nfor precisely the reasons given by the dissent. See post, at\n17\u201324. But that is not this case. As the Court explained\nin Hanna, it is an \u201cincorrect assumption that the rule of\nErie R. Co. v. Thompkins constitutes the appropriate test\nof . . . the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure.\u201d 380 U. S., at 469\u2013470. \u201cIt is true that both the\nEnabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal\ncourts are to apply state \u2018substantive\u2019 law and federal\n\u2018procedural\u2019 law,\u201d but the tests are different and reflect the\nfact that \u201cthey were designed to control very different\nsorts of decisions.\u201d Id., at 471.\n  Because Rule 23 governs class certification, the only\ndecision is whether certifying a class in this diversity case\nwould \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify\u201d New York\u2019s substantive\nrights or remedies. \u00a72072(b). Although one can argue\nthat class certification would enlarge New York\u2019s \u201climited\u201d\ndamages remedy, see post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, such\narguments rest on extensive speculation about what the\nNew York Legislature had in mind when it created\n\u00a7901(b). But given that there are two plausible competing\nnarratives, it seems obvious to me that we should respect\nthe plain textual reading of \u00a7901(b), a rule in New York\u2019s\nprocedural code about when to certify class actions\nbrought under any source of law, and respect Congress\u2019\ndecision that Rule 23 governs class certification in federal\ncourts. In order to displace a federal rule, there must be\nmore than just a possibility that the state rule is different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nprocedural vehicle; without a lower filing fee, a conveniently located\n\ncourthouse, easy-to-use federal procedural rules, or many other fea\n\ntures of the federal courts, many plaintiffs would not sue. \n\n\f22     SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

If Shady Grove had filed suit in New York state\ncourt, the 2% interest payment authorized by New York\nIns. Law Ann. \u00a75106(a) (West 2009) as a penalty for over\ndue benefits would, by Shady Grove\u2019s own measure,\namount to no more than $500. By instead filing in federal\ncourt based on the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship and request\ning class certification, Shady Grove hopes to recover, for\nthe class, statutory damages of more than $5,000,000.\nThe New York Legislature has barred this remedy, in\nstructing that, unless specifically permitted, \u201can action to\nrecover a penalty, or minimum measure of recovery cre\nated or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a\nclass action.\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. (CPLR) \u00a7901(b)\n(West 2006). The Court nevertheless holds that Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23, which prescribes procedures\nfor the conduct of class actions in federal courts, preempts\nthe application of \u00a7901(b) in diversity suits.\n  The Court reads Rule 23 relentlessly to override New\nYork\u2019s restriction on the availability of statutory damages.\n\f2        SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Justice Harlan aptly\nconveyed the importance of the doctrine; he described Erie\nas \u201cone of the modern cornerstones of our federalism,\nexpressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of\njudicial power between the state and federal systems.\u201d\nHanna v.

S., at 427, two federal statutes mark our way.\n   The first, the Rules of Decision Act,1 prohibits federal\ncourts from generating substantive law in diversity ac\ntions. See Erie, 304 U. S., at 78. Originally enacted as\npart of the Judiciary Act of 1789, this restraint serves a\npolicy of prime importance to our federal system. We have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Rules of Decision Act directs that, \u201c[t]he laws of the several\n\nstates, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or\nActs of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in\ncases where they apply.\u201d 28 U.

York, 326\nU. S. 99, 110 (1945).\n  The second, the Rules Enabling Act, enacted in 1934,\nauthorizes us to \u201cprescribe general rules of practice and\nprocedure\u201d for the federal courts, but with a crucial re\nstriction: \u201cSuch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify\nany substantive right.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72072. Pursuant to\nthis statute, we have adopted the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. In interpreting the scope of the Rules, includ\ning, in particular, Rule 23, we have been mindful of the\nlimits on our authority. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Fibreboard\nCorp., 527 U. S. 815, 845 (1999) (The Rules Enabling Act\ncounsels against \u201cadventurous application\u201d of Rule 23; any\ntension with the Act \u201cis best kept within tolerable limits.\u201d);\nAmchem Products, Inc. v.

S. 497, 503\u2013504 (2001).\n  If a Federal Rule controls an issue and directly conflicts\nwith state law, the Rule, so long as it is consonant with\nthe Rules Enabling Act, applies in diversity suits. See\nHanna, 380 U. S., at 469\u2013474. If, however, no Federal\nRule or statute governs the issue, the Rules of Decision\nAct, as interpreted in Erie, controls. That Act directs\nfederal courts, in diversity cases, to apply state law when\nfailure to do so would invite forum-shopping and yield\nmarkedly disparate litigation outcomes. See Gasperini,\n518 U. S., at 428; Hanna, 380 U. S., at 468. Recognizing\nthat the Rules of Decision Act and the Rules Enabling Act\nsimultaneously frame and inform the Erie analysis, we\nhave endeavored in diversity suits to remain safely within\nthe bounds of both congressional directives.\n                              B\n   In our prior decisions in point, many of them not men\ntioned in the Court\u2019s opinion, we have avoided immoderate\n\f4      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Rule of Procedure encompasses a\nparticular issue, a broad reading that would create signifi\ncant disuniformity between state and federal courts\nshould be avoided if the text permits.\u201d).\n   In pre-Hanna decisions, the Court vigilantly read the\nFederal Rules to avoid conflict with state laws. In Palmer\nv. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 117 (1943), for example, the\nCourt read Federal Rule 8(c), which lists affirmative de\nfenses, to control only the manner of pleading the listed\ndefenses in diversity cases; as to the burden of proof in\nsuch cases, Palmer held, state law controls.\n   Six years later, in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &\nWarehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), the Court ruled that\nstate law determines when a diversity suit commences for\npurposes of tolling the state limitations period. Although\nFederal Rule 3 specified that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced\nby filing a complaint with the court,\u201d we held that the\nRule did not displace a state law that tied an action\u2019s\ncommencement to service of the summons. Id., at 531\u2013\n533. The \u201ccause of action [wa]s created by local law,\u201d the\nCourt explained, therefore \u201cthe measure of it [wa]s to be\nfound only in local law.\u201d Id., at 533.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 541 (1949), the Court held applicable in a diver\nsity action a state statute requiring plaintiffs, as a prereq\nuisite to pursuit of a stockholder\u2019s derivative action, to\npost a bond as security for costs. At the time of the litiga\ntion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff\u2019s insti\ntution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the\nFederal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder\u2019s\nmaintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no\nconflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques\ntion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court\nobserved. See id., at 556. Burdensome as the security-for\ncosts requirement may be, Cohen made plain, suitors\ncould not escape the upfront outlay by resorting to the\nfederal court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction.\n   In all of these cases, the Court stated in Hanna, \u201cthe\nscope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing\nparty urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule\nwhich covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the\nenforcement of state law.\u201d 380 U. S., at 470. In Hanna\nitself, the Court found the clash \u201cunavoidable,\u201d ibid.; the\npetitioner had effected service of process as prescribed by\nFederal Rule 4(d)(1), but that \u201chow-to\u201d method did not\nsatisfy the special Massachusetts law applicable to service\non an executor or administrator. Even as it rejected the\nMassachusetts prescription in favor of the federal proce\ndure, however, \u201c[t]he majority in Hanna recognized . . .\nthat federal rules . . . must be interpreted by the courts\napplying them, and that the process of interpretation can\nand should reflect an awareness of legitimate state inter\nests.\u201d R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro,\nHart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal\nSystem 593 (6th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Hart & Wechsler).\n   Following Hanna, we continued to \u201cinterpre[t] the fed\neral rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory\npolicies.\u201d Hart & Wechsler 593. In Walker, the Court took\n\f6      SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.\n                 v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.\n                 GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nup the question whether Ragan should be overruled; we\nheld, once again, that Federal Rule 3 does not directly\nconflict with state rules governing the time when an ac\ntion commences for purposes of tolling a limitations pe\nriod. 446 U. S., at 749\u2013752. Rule 3, we said, addresses\nonly \u201cthe date from which various timing requirements of\nthe Federal Rules begin to run,\u201d id., at 751, and does not\n\u201cpurpor[t] to displace state tolling rules,\u201d id., at 750\u2013751.\nSignificant state policy interests would be frustrated, we\nobserved, were we to read Rule 3 as superseding the state\nrule, which required actual service on the defendant to\nstop the clock on the statute of limitations. Id., at 750\u2013\n752.\n   We were similarly attentive to a State\u2019s regulatory\npolicy in Gasperini. That diversity case concerned the\nstandard for determining when the large size of a jury\nverdict warrants a new trial. Federal and state courts\nalike had generally employed a \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test\nin reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. See 518 U. S.,\nat 422. Federal courts did so pursuant to Federal Rule\n59(a) which, as worded at the time of Gasperini, instructed\nthat a trial court could grant a new trial \u201cfor any of the\nreasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted\nin actions at law in the courts of the United States.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 59(a) (West 1995). In an effort to provide\ngreater control, New York prescribed procedures under\nwhich jury verdicts would be examined to determine\nwhether they \u201cdeviate[d] materially from what would be\nreasonable compensation.\u201d See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at\n423\u2013425 (quoting CPLR \u00a75501(c)). This Court held that\nRule 59(a) did not inhibit federal-court accommodation of\nNew York\u2019s invigorated test.\n   Most recently, in Semtek, we addressed the claim\npreclusive effect of a federal-court judgment dismissing a\ndiversity action on the basis of a California statute of\nlimitations. The case came to us after the same plaintiff\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

(Plaintiff chose Maryland because\nthat State\u2019s limitations period had not yet run.) We held\nthat Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun\ntary dismissal \u201coperate[d] as an adjudication on the mer\nits,\u201d did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in\nMaryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary\nland courts from entertaining the case, we said, \u201cwould\narguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules\nEnabling Act,\u201d 531 U. S., at 503, and \u201cwould in many cases\nviolate [Erie\u2019s] federalism principle,\u201d id., at 504.\n   In sum, both before and after Hanna, the above\ndescribed decisions show, federal courts have been cau\ntioned by this Court to \u201cinterpre[t] the Federal Rules . . .\nwith sensitivity to important state interests,\u201d Gasperini,\n518 U.

Yet\ntoday, the Court gives no quarter to New York\u2019s limitation\non statutory damages and requires the lower courts to\nthwart the regulatory policy at stake: To prevent excessive\ndamages, New York\u2019s law controls the penalty to which a\ndefendant may be exposed in a single suit. The story\nbehind \u00a7901(b)\u2019s enactment deserves telling.\n   In 1975, the Judicial Conference of the State of New\nYork proposed a new class-action statute designed \u201cto set\nup a flexible, functional scheme\u201d that would provide \u201can\neffective, but controlled group remedy.\u201d Judicial Confer\nence Report on CPLR, reprinted in 1975 N. Y. Laws\npp. 1477, 1493 (McKinney). As originally drafted, the\nlegislation addressed only the procedural aspects of class\nactions; it specified, for example, five prerequisites for\ncertification, eventually codified at \u00a7901(a), that closely\ntracked those listed in Rule 23. See CPLR \u00a7901(a) (requir\ning, for class certification, numerosity, predominance,\ntypicality, adequacy of representation, and superiority).\n   While the Judicial Conference proposal was in the New\nYork Legislature\u2019s hopper, \u201cvarious groups advocated for\nthe addition of a provision that would prohibit class action\nplaintiffs from being awarded a statutorily-created penalty\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmirror reality, as I later explain.

As the Second Circuit well un\nderstood, Rule 23 prescribes the considerations relevant to\nclass certification and postcertification proceedings\u2014but it\ndoes not command that a particular remedy be available\nwhen a party sues in a representative capacity. See 549\nF. 3d 137, 143 (2008).5 Section 901(b), in contrast, trains\non that latter issue.

This slippery-slope\nprojection is both familiar and false. Cf. R.

In this case,\nCPLR \u00a7901(a) lists the state-law prerequisites for class certification,\nbut Allstate does not contend that \u00a7901(a) overrides Rule 23. Brief for\nRespondent 18 (\u201cThere is no dispute that the criteria for class certifica\ntion under state law do not apply in federal court; that is the ground\nsquarely occupied by Rule 23.\u201d). Federal courts sitting in diversity have\nroutinely applied Rule 23\u2019s certification standards, rather than compa\nrable state provisions. See, e.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\nExport Antitrust Litigation, 522 F. 3d 6, 18\u201324 (CA1 2008); Order and\nReasons in In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation, Civ.\nAction No. 05\u20134182 (ED La., Aug. 6, 2009).\n\f12       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  In other words, Rule 23 describes a method of enforcing\na claim for relief, while \u00a7901(b) defines the dimensions of\nthe claim itself. In this regard, it is immaterial that\n\u00a7901(b) bars statutory penalties in wholesale, rather than\nretail, fashion. The New York Legislature could have\nembedded the limitation in every provision creating a\ncause of action for which a penalty is authorized; \u00a7901(b)\noperates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a\npart of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be\nwere it included claim by claim in the New York Code.\n  The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit\n\u201cmay\u201d or \u201cmay not\u201d be maintained as a class action. See\nante, at 4\u20136. Putting the question that way, the Court\ndoes not home in on the reason why. Rule 23 authorizes\nclass treatment for suits satisfying its prerequisites be\ncause the class mechanism generally affords a fair and\nefficient way to aggregate claims for adjudication. Section\n901(b) responds to an entirely different concern; it does\nnot allow class members to recover statutory damages\nbecause the New York Legislature considered the result of\nadjudicating such claims en masse to be exorbitant.6 The\nfair and efficient conduct of class litigation is the legiti\nmate concern of Rule 23; the remedy for an infraction of\nstate law, however, is the legitimate concern of the State\u2019s\nlawmakers and not of the federal rulemakers. Cf. Ely, The\nIrrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 722\n(1974) (It is relevant \u201cwhether the state provision embod\nies a substantive policy or represents only a procedural\ndisagreement with the federal rulemakers respecting the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court disputes the strength of the evidence of legislative intent,\n\nsee ante, at 9, but offers no alternative account of \u00a7901(b)\u2019s purpose.\nPerhaps this silence indicates how very hard it would be to ascribe to\n\u00a7901(b) any purpose bound up with the fairness and efficiency of\nprocessing cases. On its face, the proscription is concerned with reme\ndies, i.e., the availability of statutory damages in a lawsuit. Legislative\nhistory confirms this objective, but is not essential to revealing it.\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nnotion that one directly impinges on Rule 23\u2019s domain,\nwhile the other does not, fundamentally misperceives the\noffice of Rule 23.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 There   is, of course, a difference between \u201cjustly administering [a]\nremedy,\u201d Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U. S. 1, 14 (1941), and prescrib\ning the content of that remedy; if Rule 23 can be read to increase a\nplaintiff\u2019s recovery from $1,000,000 to some greater amount, the Rule\nhas arguably \u201cenlarge[d] . . .

The plurality appears to\nacknowledge this point, stating that the Federal Rules we have found\nto be in compliance with the Act have not \u201caltered . . . available reme\ndies.\u201d Ante, at 13. But the Court\u2019s relentless reading of Rule 23 today\ndoes exactly that: The Federal Rule, it says, authorizes the recovery of\nclass-size statutory damages even though the New York provision\ninstructs that such penalties shall not be available.\n  8 The Court states that \u201c[w]e cannot rewrite [a state law] to reflect\n\nour perception of legislative purpose.\u201d Ante, at 9. But we can, of\ncourse, interpret the Federal Rules in light of a State\u2019s regulatory policy\nto decide whether and to what extent a Rule preempts state law. See\nsupra, at 3\u20137. Just as we read Federal Rule 3 in Walker v. Armco Steel\nCorp., 446 U. S. 740, 751 (1980), not to govern when a suit commences\n\f14       SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

CO.\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The absence of an inevitable collision between Rule 23\nand \u00a7901(b) becomes evident once it is comprehended that\na federal court sitting in diversity can accord due respect\nto both state and federal prescriptions. Plaintiffs seeking\nto vindicate claims for which the State has provided a\nstatutory penalty may pursue relief through a class action\nif they forgo statutory damages and instead seek actual\ndamages or injunctive or declaratory relief; any putative\nclass member who objects can opt out and pursue actual\ndamages, if available, and the statutory penalty in an\nindividual action. See, e.g., Mendez v. The Radec Corp.,\n260 F. R. D. 38, 55 (WDNY 2009); Brzychnalski v. Unesco,\nInc., 35 F. Supp. 2d 351, 353 (SDNY 1999).9 See also\nAlexander, Practice Commentaries, at 105 (\u201cEven if a\nstatutory penalty or minimum recovery is involved, most\ncourts hold that it can be waived, thus confining the class\nrecovery to actual damages and eliminating the bar of\nCPLR 901(b).\u201d). In this manner, the Second Circuit ex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfor purposes of tolling a state statute of limitations (although the Rule\nindisputably controls when an action commences for federal procedural\npurposes), so too we could read Rule 23 not to direct when a class action\nmay be maintained for purposes of recovering statutory damages\nprescribed by state law. On this reading of Rule 23, no rewriting of\n\u00a7901(b) is necessary to avoid a conflict.\n  9 The New York Legislature appears to have anticipated this result.\n\nIn discussing the remedial bar effected by \u00a7901(b), the bill\u2019s sponsor\nexplained that a \u201cstatutory class action for actual damages would still\nbe permissible.\u201d S.

On this understand\ning, New York courts routinely authorize class actions when the class\nwaives its right to receive statutory penalties. See, e.g., Cox v.

In sum,\nwhile phrased as responsive to the question whether\ncertain class actions may begin, \u00a7901(b) is unmistakably\naimed at controlling how those actions must end. On that\nremedial issue, Rule 23 is silent.\n  Any doubt whether Rule 23 leaves \u00a7901(b) in control of\nthe remedial issue at the core of this case should be dis\npelled by our Erie jurisprudence, including Hanna, which\ncounsels us to read Federal Rules moderately and cautions\nagainst stretching a rule to cover every situation it could\nconceivably reach.10 The Court states that \u201c[t]here is no\nreason . . . to read Rule 23 as addressing only whether\nclaims made eligible for class treatment by some other law\nshould be certified as class actions.\u201d Ante, at 5. To the\ncontrary, Palmer, Ragan, Cohen, Walker, Gasperini, and\nSemtek provide good reason to look to the law that creates\nthe right to recover. See supra, at 4\u20137. That is plainly so\non a more accurate statement of what is at stake: Is there\nany reason to read Rule 23 as authorizing a claim for relief\nwhen the State that created the remedy disallows its\npursuit on behalf of a class? None at all is the answer our\nfederal system should give.\n  Notably, New York is not alone in its effort to contain\npenalties and minimum recoveries by disallowing class\nrelief; Congress, too, has precluded class treatment for\ncertain claims seeking a statutorily designated minimum\nrecovery. See, e.g., 15 U. S.

See, e.g., Cohen, 337 U. S., at 555; cf. Woods v. Inter\nstate Realty Co., 337 U.

Statutes of limitations are, again, exemplary.\nThey supply \u201csubstantive\u201d law in diversity suits, see York,\n326 U.

Similarly, federal courts\nsitting in diversity give effect to state laws governing the\nburden of proving contributory negligence, see Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U.

See Restatement \u00a7133 and Re\nporter\u2019s Note.\n   In short, Shady Grove\u2019s effort to characterize \u00a7901(b) as\nsimply \u201cprocedural\u201d cannot successfully elide this funda\nmental norm: When no federal law or rule is dispositive of\nan issue, and a state statute is outcome affective in the\nsense our cases on Erie (pre- and post-Hanna) develop, the\nRules of Decision Act commands application of the State\u2019s\nlaw in diversity suits.

As\nthis case starkly demonstrates, if federal courts exercising\ndiversity jurisdiction are compelled by Rule 23 to award\nstatutory penalties in class actions while New York courts\nare bound by \u00a7901(b)\u2019s proscription, \u201csubstantial varia\ntions between state and federal [money judgments] may be\nexpected.\u201d Gasperini, 518 U.

In\nCAFA, Congress opened federal-court doors to state-law\nbased class actions so long as there is minimal diversity,\nat least 100 class members, and at least $5,000,000 in\ncontroversy. Ibid. By providing a federal forum, Congress\nsought to check what it considered to be the overreadiness\nof some state courts to certify class actions. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 109\u201314, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers\nfrom \u201cgam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide\nor multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges\nhave reputations for readily certifying classes.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving \u201cthe \u2018I\nnever met a class action I didn\u2019t like\u2019 approach to class\ncertification\u201d that \u201cis prevalent in state courts in some\nlocalities\u201d). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer\u2014\nnot more\u2014class actions overall. Congress surely never\nanticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a mecca\nfor suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched: class\nactions seeking state-created penalties for claims arising\nunder state law\u2014claims that would be barred from class\ntreatment in the State\u2019s own courts.

KENTUCKY\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n    No. 08\u2013651.      Argued October 13, 2009\u2014Decided March 31, 2010\nPetitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for\n  over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug\n  distribution charges in Kentucky. In postconviction proceedings, he\n  claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this conse\n  quence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry\n  about deportation since he had lived in this country so long. He al\n  leges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incor\n  rect advice. The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconvic\n  tion relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s effective\n  assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from er\n  roneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a \u201ccollat\n  eral\u201d consequence of a conviction.\nHeld: Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a\n risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel\n was constitutionally deficient. Whether he is entitled to relief de\n pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed\n here. Pp. 2\u201318.\n    (a) Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the\n stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal conviction. While once there was\n only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad\n discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms\n have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges\u2019\n authority to alleviate deportation\u2019s harsh consequences. Because the\n drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable\n for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance\n of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never\n been more important. Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is\n an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen de\n fendants who plead guilty to specified crimes. Pp. 2\u20136.\n\f2                         PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, applies to Padilla\u2019s\n    claim. Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is enti\n    tled to \u201cthe effective assistance of competent counsel.\u201d McMann v.\n    Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771. The Supreme Court of Kentucky re\n    jected Padilla\u2019s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he\n    sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters. How\n    ever, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collat\n    eral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally \u201creason\n    able professional assistance\u201d required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n    689. The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not\n    be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deporta\n    tion. Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is inti\n    mately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely diffi\n    cult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. Because\n    that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim\n    concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deporta\n    tion is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amend\n    ment right to counsel. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (c) To satisfy Strickland\u2019s two-prong inquiry, counsel\u2019s representa\n    tion must fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d 466\n    U. S., at 688, and there must be \u201ca reasonable probability that, but\n    for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\n    have been different,\u201d id., at 694. The first, constitutional deficiency,\n    is necessarily linked to the legal community\u2019s practice and expecta\n    tions. Id., at 688. The weight of prevailing professional norms sup\n    ports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the de\n    portation risk. And this Court has recognized the importance to the\n    client of \u201c \u2018[p]reserving the . . . right to remain in the United States\u2019 \u201d\n    and \u201cpreserving the possibility of\u201d discretionary relief from deporta\n    tion. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 323. Thus, this is not a hard case\n    in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could\n    easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deporta\n    tion was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was in\n    correct. There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in\n    which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear. In those\n    cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a\n    noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse\n    immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is\n    truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally\n    clear. Accepting Padilla\u2019s allegations as true, he has sufficiently al\n    leged constitutional deficiency to satisfy Strickland\u2019s first prong.\n    Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the\n    Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance. Pp. 9\u201312.\n       (d) The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed rule\u2014that Strickland should\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  be applied to Padilla\u2019s claim only to the extent that he has alleged af\n  firmative misadvice\u2014is unpersuasive. And though this Court must\n  be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\n  guilty pleas, the 25 years since Strickland was first applied to inef\n  fective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are\n  less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions\n  after a trial. Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can\n  benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to\n  reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.\n  This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions\n  obtained through plea bargains.

KENTUCKY\n     ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       KENTUCKY\n\n                                 [March 31, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Jose Padilla, a native of Honduras, has been\na lawful permanent resident of the United States for more\nthan 40 years. Padilla served this Nation with honor as a\nmember of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam\nWar. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the\ntransportation of a large amount of marijuana in his\ntractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1\n   In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his\ncounsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence\nprior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he\n\u201c \u2018did not have to worry about immigration status since he\nhad been in the country so long.\u2019 \u201d 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483\n(Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel\u2019s erroneous ad\nvice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made\nhis deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he\nwould have insisted on going to trial if he had not received\nincorrect advice from his attorney.\n   Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Padilla\u2019s crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the\n\nmost insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n\f2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief\nwithout the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant\nfrom erroneous advice about deportation because it is\nmerely a \u201ccollateral\u201d consequence of his conviction. Id., at\n485. In its view, neither counsel\u2019s failure to advise peti\ntioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel\u2019s incor\nrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide\nwhether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\u2019s counsel had\nan obligation to advise him that the offense to which he\nwas pleading guilty would result in his removal from this\ncountry. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally\ncompetent counsel would have advised him that his con\nviction for drug distribution made him subject to auto\nmatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief de\npends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that\nwe do not address.\n                              I\n   The landscape of federal immigration law has changed\ndramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was\nonly a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges\nwielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta\ntion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the\nclass of deportable offenses and limited the authority of\njudges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.\nThe \u201cdrastic measure\u201d of deportation or removal, Fong\nHaw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948), is now virtually\ninevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of\ncrimes.\n   The Nation\u2019s first 100 years was \u201ca period of unimpeded\nimmigration.\u201d C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration\nLaw and Procedure \u00a71.(2)(a), p. 5 (1959). An early effort to\nempower the President to order the deportation of those\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

Gordon \u00a71.2, at 5. It\nwas not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute\nbarring convicts and prostitutes from entering the coun\ntry, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon\n\u00a71.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of exclud\nable persons those \u201cwho have been convicted of a felony or\nother infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral\nturpitude.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.2\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1917 (1917 Act)\nbrought \u201cradical changes\u201d to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515,\n81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 54\u201355 (1950). For the first time\nin our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens de\nportable based on conduct committed on American soil.\nId., at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the de\nportation of \u201cany alien who is hereafter sentenced to im\nprisonment for a term of one year or more because of\nconviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpi\ntude, committed within five years after the entry of the\nalien to the United States . . . .\u201d 39 Stat. 889. And \u00a719\nalso rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who com\nmit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time\nafter entry. Ibid. Congress did not, however, define the\nterm \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d\n   While the 1917 Act was \u201cradical\u201d because it authorized\ndeportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the\nAct also included a critically important procedural protec\ntion to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the\ntime of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sen\ntencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had\nthe power to make a recommendation \u201cthat such alien\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In 1907, Congress expanded the class of excluded persons to include\n\nindividuals who \u201cadmit\u201d to having committed a crime of moral turpi\ntude. Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, 34 Stat. 899.\n\f4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshall not be deported.\u201d Id., at 890.3 This procedure,\nknown as a judicial recommendation against deportation,\nor JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to pre\nvent deportation; the statute was \u201cconsistently . . . inter\npreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority\nto decide whether a particular conviction should be disre\ngarded as a basis for deportation,\u201d Janvier v. United\nStates, 793 F. 2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917\nforward, there was no such creature as an automatically\ndeportable offense. Even as the class of deportable of\nfenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate\nunjust results on a case-by-case basis.\n   Although narcotics offenses\u2014such as the offense at\nissue in this case\u2014provided a distinct basis for deporta\ntion as early as 1922,4 the JRAD procedure was generally\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Asenacted, the statute provided:\n\u201cThat the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens\nconvicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one\nwho has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed\nif the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall,\nat the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty\ndays thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor\nthat such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.\u201d 1917\nAct, 39 Stat. 889\u2013890.\nThis provision was codified in 8 U. S. C. \u00a71251(b) (1994 ed.) (transferred\nto \u00a71227 (2006 ed. )). The judge\u2019s nondeportation recommendation was\nbinding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after\ncontrol of immigration removal matters was transferred from the\nformer to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452\n(CA2 1986).\n   4 Congress first identified narcotics offenses as a special category of\n\ncrimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of\nMay 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect,\nthere was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also\nhad to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable.\nSee Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F. 2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an\nindividual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because\noffense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts even\ntually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was \u201cspecial,\u201d Chung\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\navailable to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.\nSee United States v. O\u2019Rourke, 213 F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8\n1954). Except for \u201ctechnical, inadvertent and insignificant\nviolations of the laws relating to narcotics,\u201d ibid., it ap\npears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act\u2019s\nbroad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until\n1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case \u201cwas effective to prevent\ndeportation\u201d (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F. 2d 379,\n380\u2013381 (CA9 1934))).\n   In light of both the steady expansion of deportable\noffenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD,\nit is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the Second Circuit held that\nthe Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see\nJanvier, 793 F. 2d 449. See also United States v. Castro,\n26 F. 3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was\n\u201cpart of the sentencing\u201d process, Janvier, 793 F. 2d, at 452,\neven if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Sec\nond Circuit\u2019s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a\nnoncitizen\u2019s ability to remain in the country was a central\nissue to be resolved during the sentencing process\u2014not\nmerely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel\u2019s\nduty to provide effective representation.\n   However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our\nlaw. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in\nthe 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5 and in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nQue Fong v. Nagle, 15 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics\noffense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy\nother requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United\nStates ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F. 2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v.\nMunster, 62 F. 2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933).\n   5 The Act separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision\n\nand the narcotics offense provision within 8 U. S. C. \u00a71251(a) (1994 ed.)\nunder subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204,\n\f6                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In\n1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General\u2019s\nauthority to grant discretionary relief from deportation,\n110 Stat. 3009\u2013596, an authority that had been exercised\nto prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens\nduring the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289, 296 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a non\ncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996\neffective date of these amendments, his removal is practi\ncally inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited\nremnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney\nGeneral to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of\nparticular classes of offenses.6 See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229b.\nSubject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is\nnot available for an offense related to trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance. See \u00a71101(a)(43)(B); \u00a71228.\n   These changes to our immigration law have dramati\ncally raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal convic\ntion. The importance of accurate legal advice for nonciti\nzens accused of crimes has never been more important.\nThese changes confirm our view that, as a matter of fed\neral law, deportation is an integral part\u2014indeed, some\ntimes the most important part 7\u2014of the penalty that may\nbe imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to\nspecified crimes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U. S. C. \u00a71251(b) (1994 ed.),\napplied only to the \u201cprovisions of subsection (a)(4),\u201d the crimes-of-moral\nturpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O\u2019Rourke, 213\nF. 2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 Act,\nnarcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs).\n  6 The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in\n\nnomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term \u201cremoval\u201d rather\nthan \u201cdeportation.\u201d See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U. S. 348, 350,\nn. 1 (2001).\n  7 See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n12\u201327 (providing real-world examples).\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771 (1970); Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 686. The Supreme Court of Kentucky\nrejected Padilla\u2019s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that\nthe advice he sought about the risk of deportation con\ncerned only collateral matters, i.e., those matters not\nwithin the sentencing authority of the state trial court.8\n253 S. W. 3d, at 483\u2013484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuar\ntado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, \u201ccollateral\nconsequences are outside the scope of representation\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and, therefore, the\n\u201cfailure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of\npossible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d 253 S. W. 3d,\nat 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this\nview.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distin\n\nguish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Igno\nrance is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misin\nformation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15\n(2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral\ndistinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as\neven JUSTICE ALITO agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a\nnoncitizen \u201cdefendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse\nimmigration consequences,\u201d post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nSee also post, at 14 (\u201cI do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amend\nment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinforma\ntion\u201d). In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO has thus departed from\nthe strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the\ntwo federal cases that he cites, post, at 2.\n   9 See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20 (CA1 2000); United\n\nStates v. Del Rosario, 902 F. 2d 55 (CADC 1990); United States v.\nYearwood, 863 F. 2d 6 (CA4 1988); Santos-Sanchez v.

KENTUCKY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We, however, have never applied a distinction between\ndirect and collateral consequences to define the scope of\nconstitutionally \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d\nrequired under Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689. Whether\nthat distinction is appropriate is a question we need not\nconsider in this case because of the unique nature of\ndeportation.\n   We have long recognized that deportation is a particu\nlarly severe \u201cpenalty,\u201d Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149\nU. S. 698, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a\ncriminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil\nin nature, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038\n(1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to\nthe criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal\nconvictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a\ncentury, see Part I, supra, at 2\u20137. And, importantly,\nrecent changes in our immigration law have made removal\nnearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen\noffenders. Thus, we find it \u201cmost difficult\u201d to divorce the\npenalty from the conviction in the deportation context.\nUnited States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982).\nMoreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defen\ndants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense\nfind it even more difficult. See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322\n(\u201cThere can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien\ndefendants considering whether to enter into a plea\nagreement are acutely aware of the immigration conse\nquences of their convictions\u201d).\n   Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is,\nbecause of its close connection to the criminal process,\nuniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collat\neral consequence.

Ibid.,\nn. 50.\n   In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence for Padilla\u2019s conviction.           See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(B)(i) (\u201cAny alien who at any time after\nadmission has been convicted of a violation of (or a con\nspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a\nState, the United States or a foreign country relating to a\ncontrolled substance . . . , other than a single offense in\nvolving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of\nmarijuana, is deportable\u201d). Padilla\u2019s counsel could have\neasily determined that his plea would make him eligible\nfor deportation simply from reading the text of the statute,\nwhich addresses not some broad classification of crimes\nbut specifically commands removal for all controlled sub\nstances convictions except for the most trivial of mari\njuana possession offenses.        Instead, Padilla\u2019s counsel\nprovided him false assurance that his conviction would not\nresult in his removal from this country. This is not a hard\ncase in which to find deficiency: The consequences of\nPadilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the\nremoval statute, his deportation was presumptively man\ndatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.\n   Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal spe\ncialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent\nclients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal\ncourt or both, may not be well versed in it. There will,\ntherefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which\nthe deportation consequences of a particular plea are\nunclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner\nin such cases is more limited. When the law is not suc\ncinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios\n\f12                     PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nposited by JUSTICE ALITO), a criminal defense attorney\nneed do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pend\ning criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences.10 But when the deportation conse\nquence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to\ngive correct advice is equally clear.\n   Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has suffi\nciently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first\nprong of Strickland. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief\non his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy Strick\nland\u2019s second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the\nKentucky courts to consider in the first instance.\n                              IV\n   The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that\nStrickland applies to Padilla\u2019s claim only to the extent\nthat he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United\nStates\u2019 view, \u201ccounsel is not constitutionally required to\nprovide advice on matters that will not be decided in the\ncriminal case . . . ,\u201d though counsel is required to provide\naccurate advice if she chooses to discusses these matters.\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General\u2019s\nproposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support\namong the lower courts. See, e.g., United States v. Couto,\n311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407\nF. 3d 1005 (CA9 2005); Sparks v. Sowders, 852 F. 2d 882\n(CA6 1988); United States v.

M. 533, 538\u2013539.\n   A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite\ntwo absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incen\ntive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even\nwhen answers are readily available. Silence under these\ncircumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the\ncritical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \u201cthe\nadvantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\u201d\nLibretti v.

KENTUCKY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nconcurring in judgment).\n   We have given serious consideration to the concerns\nthat the Solicitor General, respondent, and amici have\nstressed regarding the importance of protecting the final\nity of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We con\nfronted a similar \u201cfloodgates\u201d concern in Hill, see id., at\n58, but nevertheless applied Strickland to a claim that\ncounsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole\neligibility before he pleaded guilty.12\n   A flood did not follow in that decision\u2019s wake. Sur\nmounting Strickland\u2019s high bar is never an easy task.\nSee, e.g., 466 U. S., at 689 (\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s\nperformance must be highly deferential\u201d); id., at 693\n(observing that \u201c[a]ttorney errors . . . are as likely to be\nutterly harmless in a particular case as they are to be\nprejudicial\u201d). Moreover, to obtain relief on this type of\nclaim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision\nto reject the plea bargain would have been rational under\nthe circumstances. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S.\n470, 480, 486 (2000). There is no reason to doubt that\nlower courts\u2014now quite experienced with applying Strick\nland\u2014can effectively and efficiently use its framework to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 However, we concluded that, even though Strickland applied to\n\npetitioner\u2019s claim, he had not sufficiently alleged prejudice to satisfy\nStrickland\u2019s second prong. Hill, 474 U. S., at 59\u201360. This disposition\nfurther underscores the fact that it is often quite difficult for petitioners\nwho have acknowledged their guilt to satisfy Strickland\u2019s prejudice\nprong.\n  JUSTICE ALITO believes that the Court misreads Hill, post, at 10\u201311.\nIn Hill, the Court recognized\u2014for the first time\u2014that Strickland\napplies to advice respecting a guilty plea. 474 U. S., at 58 (\u201cWe hold,\ntherefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies to\nchallenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d).\nIt is true that Hill does not control the question before us. But its\nimport is nevertheless clear. Whether Strickland applies to Padilla\u2019s\nclaim follows from Hill, regardless of the fact that the Hill Court did\nnot resolve the particular question respecting misadvice that was\nbefore it.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

For at least the past 15 years,\nprofessional norms have generally imposed an obligation\non counsel to provide advice on the deportation conse\nquences of a client\u2019s plea. See, supra, at 11\u201313. We\nshould, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their\nobligation to render competent advice at the time their\nclients considered pleading guilty. Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 689.\n   Likewise, although we must be especially careful about\nrecognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\nguilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied Strick\nland to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage,\npractice has shown that pleas are less frequently the\nsubject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained\nafter a trial. Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal\nconvictions.13 But they account for only approximately\n30% of the habeas petitions filed.14 The nature of relief\nsecured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty\nplea\u2014an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to\ntrial\u2014imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those\nwho collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of\nthe bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a dif\nferent calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of\n\nCriminal Justice Statistics 2003, p. 418 (31st ed. 2005) (Table 5.17)\n(only approximately 5%, or 8,612 out of 68,533, of federal criminal\nprosecutions go to trial); id., at 450 (Table 5.46) (only approximately 5%\nof all state felony criminal prosecutions go to trial).\n   14 See V. Flango, National Center for State Courts, Habeas Corpus in\n\nState and Federal Courts 36\u201338 (1994) (demonstrating that 5% of\ndefendants whose conviction was the result of a trial account for ap\nproximately 70% of the habeas petitions filed).\n\f16                     PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nguilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately,\nthe challenge may result in a less favorable outcome for\nthe defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a convic\ntion obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside\npotential.\n   Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation\ncan only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants\nduring the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deporta\ntion consequences into this process, the defense and prose\ncution may well be able to reach agreements that better\nsatisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a\ncriminal episode may provide the basis for multiple\ncharges, of which only a subset mandate deportation\nfollowing conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudi\nmentary understanding of the deportation consequences of\na particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain\ncreatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction\nand sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as\nby avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically\ntriggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the\nthreat of deportation may provide the defendant with a\npowerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does\nnot mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a\ncharge that does.\n   In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of\na plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes\nof the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel.

Our longstanding Sixth\nAmendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as\na consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant\nimpact of deportation on families living lawfully in this\ncountry demand no less.\n   Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconvic\ntion relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla\nhas sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitution\nally deficient.

As the\nCourt concedes, \u201c[i]mmigration law can be complex\u201d; \u201cit is\na legal specialty of its own\u201d; and \u201c[s]ome members of the\nbar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in\neither state or federal court or both, may not be well\nversed in it.\u201d Ante, at 11. The Court nevertheless holds\nthat a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in\nthis specialized area in those cases in which the law is\n\u201csuccinct and straightforward\u201d\u2014but not, perhaps, in other\nsituations. Ante, at 11\u201312. This vague, halfway test will\nlead to much confusion and needless litigation.\n\f2                   PADILLA v.

S., at 688.\nUntil today, the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe federal courts was that reasonable defense counsel\ngenerally need only advise a client about the direct conse\nquences of a criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v.\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim fails if \u201cbased on an attorney\u2019s\nfailure to advise a client of his plea\u2019s immigration conse\nquences\u201d); United States v.

While the line between \u201cdirect\u201d\nand \u201ccollateral\u201d consequences is not always clear, see ante,\nat 7, n. 8, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an\nimportant truth: Criminal defense attorneys have exper\ntise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings. They\nare not expected to possess\u2014and very often do not pos\nsess\u2014expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unreal\nistic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters\nthat lie outside their area of training and experience.\n   This case happens to involve removal, but criminal\nconvictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other\nthan conviction and sentencing, including civil commit\nment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disquali\nfication from public benefits, ineligibility to possess fire\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

A criminal conviction may also severely damage\na defendant\u2019s reputation and thus impair the defendant\u2019s\nability to obtain future employment or business opportuni\nties. All of those consequences are \u201cseriou[s],\u201d see ante, at\n17, but this Court has never held that a criminal defense\nattorney\u2019s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing\nadvice about such matters.\n   The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from\nprecedent by pointing to the views of various professional\norganizations. See ante, at 9 (\u201cThe weight of prevailing\nprofessional norms supports the view that counsel must\nadvise her client regarding the risk of deportation\u201d).\nHowever, ascertaining the level of professional competence\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for\nthe courts. E.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 477\n(2000). Although we may appropriately consult standards\npromulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to\nthese groups our task of determining what the Constitu\ntion commands. See Strickland, supra, at 688 (explaining\nthat \u201c[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in Ameri\ncan Bar Association standards . . . are guides to determin\ning what is reasonable, but they are only guides\u201d). And we\nmust recognize that such standards may represent only\nthe aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical\nassessment of actual practice.\n   Even if the only relevant consideration were \u201cprevailing\nprofessional norms,\u201d it is hard to see how those norms can\nsupport the duty the Court today imposes on defense\ncounsel. Because many criminal defense attorneys have\nlittle understanding of immigration law, see ante, at 11, it\nshould follow that a criminal defense attorney who re\nfrains from providing immigration advice does not violate\nprevailing professional norms. But the Court\u2019s opinion\nwould not just require defense counsel to warn the client\n\f4                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof a general risk of removal; it would also require counsel\nin at least some cases, to specify what the removal conse\nquences of a conviction would be. See ante, at 11\u201312.\n   The Court\u2019s new approach is particularly problematic\nbecause providing advice on whether a conviction for a\nparticular offense will make an alien removable is often\nquite complex. \u201cMost crimes affecting immigration status\nare not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad\ncategory of crimes, such as crimes involving moral turpi\ntude or aggravated felonies.\u201d M.

I therefore can\nnot agree with the Court\u2019s apparent view that the Sixth\nAmendment requires criminal defense attorneys to pro\nvide immigration advice.\n   The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it\nimposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of\ncounsel\u2019s duty to offer advice concerning deportation con\nsequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those\nconsequences. Where \u201cthe terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence[s]\u201d of a conviction, the Court says,\ncounsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that\nhe will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea.\nAnte, at 11. But \u201c[w]hen the law is not succinct and\nstraightforward . . . , a criminal defense attorney need do\nno more than advise a noncitizen client that pending\ncriminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration\nconsequences.\u201d Ante, at 11\u201312. This approach is problem\natic for at least four reasons.\n   First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a par\nticular statutory provision is \u201csuccinct, clear, and explicit.\u201d\nHow can an attorney who lacks general immigration law\nexpertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provi\nsion actually means what it seems to say when read in\n\f8                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nisolation? What if the application of the provision to a\nparticular case is not clear but a cursory examination of\ncase law or administrative decisions would provide a\ndefinitive answer? See Immigration Law and Crimes \u00a72:1,\nat 2\u20132 (\u201cUnfortunately, a practitioner or respondent can\nnot tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable\noffense. . . . [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive\nrespondent will not know conclusively the future immigra\ntion consequences of a guilty plea\u201d).\n   Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regard\ning only one of the many collateral consequences of a\ncriminal conviction, many defendants are likely to be\nmisled. To take just one example, a conviction for a par\nticular offense may render an alien excludable but not\nremovable. If an alien charged with such an offense is\nadvised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will\nnot result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a\nguilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the\nplea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United\nStates if the alien returns to his or her home country for\nany reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend\na funeral. See ABA Guidebook \u00a74.14, at 111 (\u201cOften the\nalien is both excludable and removable. At times, how\never, the lists are different. Thus, the oddity of an alien\nthat is inadmissible but not deportable. This alien should\nnot leave the United States because the government will\nnot let him back in\u201d (emphasis in original)). Incomplete\nlegal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it\nmay mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking\nadvice from a more knowledgeable source.\n   Third, the Court\u2019s rigid constitutional rule could inad\nvertently head off more promising ways of addressing the\nunderlying problem\u2014such as statutory or administrative\nreforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the\nrecord that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration\nconsequences. As amici point out, \u201c28 states and the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

A\nnonconstitutional rule requiring trial judges to inform\ndefendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences can ensure that a defendant receives\nneeded information without putting a large number of\ncriminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning\nwould be given on the record, courts would not later have\nto determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting\nthe advice of counsel. Likewise, flexible statutory proce\ndures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts\nappropriate discretion to determine whether the interests\nof justice would be served by allowing a particular defen\ndant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of in\ncomplete information. Cf. United States v. Russell, 686\nF. 2d 35, 39\u201340 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district\ncourt\u2019s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Fed\neral Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by,\namong other considerations, \u201cthe possible existence of\nprejudice to the government\u2019s case as a result of the de\nfendant\u2019s untimely request to stand trial\u201d and \u201cthe\nstrength of the defendant\u2019s reason for withdrawing the\nplea, including whether the defendant asserts his inno\ncence of the charge\u201d).\n   Fourth, the Court\u2019s decision marks a major upheaval in\nSixth Amendment law. This Court decided Strickland in\n1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this\nor any other federal court, holding that criminal defense\ncounsel\u2019s failure to provide advice concerning the removal\nconsequences of a criminal conviction violates a defen\ndant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As noted above,\nthe Court\u2019s view has been rejected by every Federal Court\n\f10                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof Appeals to have considered the issue thus far. See, e.g.,\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d, at 28; Banda, 1 F. 3d, at 355; Chin &\nHolmes 697, 699. The majority appropriately acknowl\nedges that the lower courts are \u201cnow quite experienced\nwith applying Strickland,\u201d ante, at 14, but it casually\ndismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe lower federal courts with respect to the scope of\ncriminal defense counsel\u2019s duty to advise on collateral\nconsequences.\n   The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion\nof the scope of criminal defense counsel\u2019s duties under the\nSixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in Hill v.\nLockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), similarly \u201capplied Strick\nland to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client\nregarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.\u201d\nAnte, at 14. That characterization of Hill obscures much\nmore than it reveals. The issue in Hill was whether a\ncriminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nwas violated where counsel misinformed the client about\nhis eligibility for parole. The Court found it \u201cunnecessary\nto determine whether there may be circumstances under\nwhich erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility\nmay be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, because in the present case we conclude that\npetitioner\u2019s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the\nStrickland v. Washington requirement of \u2018prejudice.\u2019 \u201d 474\nU. S., at 60. Given that Hill expressly and unambiguously\nrefused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must\navoid misinforming his or her client as to one consequence\nof a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case\nplainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition\nthat counsel must affirmatively advise his or her client as\nto another collateral consequence (removal).        By the\nCourt\u2019s strange logic, Hill would support its decision here\neven if the Court had held that misadvice concerning\nparole eligibility does not make counsel\u2019s performance\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nobjectively unreasonable. After all, the Court still would\nhave \u201capplied Strickland\u201d to the facts of the case at hand.\n                                II\n  While mastery of immigration law is not required by\nStrickland, several considerations support the conclu\nsion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal\nconsequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective\nassistance.\n  First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding\na matter as crucial to the defendant\u2019s plea decision as\ndeportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the\nSixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its\npast cases. In particular, we have explained that \u201ca guilty\nplea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal\nadvice unless counsel was not \u2018a reasonably competent\nattorney\u2019 and the advice was not \u2018within the range of\ncompetence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u2019 \u201d\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann v. Richard\nson, 397 U. S. 759, 770, 771 (1970); emphasis added). As\nthe Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understand\ning of the intricacies of immigration law is not \u201cwithin the\nrange of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\ncases.\u201d See ante, at 11 (\u201cImmigration law can be complex,\nand it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the\nbar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in\neither state or federal court or both, may not be well\nversed in it\u201d). By contrast, reasonably competent attor\nneys should know that it is not appropriate or responsible\nto hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and\ncomplicated subject matter with which they are not famil\niar. Candor concerning the limits of one\u2019s professional\nexpertise, in other words, is within the range of duties\nreasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases.\nAs the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court\nput it, \u201cI do not believe it is too much of a burden to place\n\f12                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\non our defense bar the duty to say, \u2018I do not know.\u2019 \u201d 253\nS. W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).\n   Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant\u2019s\ndecisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and\nintegrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (\u201cIn giving meaning to\nthe requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we\nmust take its purpose\u2014to ensure a fair trial\u2014as the\nguide\u201d). When a defendant opts to plead guilty without\ndefinitive information concerning the likely effects of the\nplea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk\nthat the conviction may carry indirect consequences of\nwhich he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a\ndefendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel\u2019s\nexpress misrepresentation that the defendant will not be\nremovable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that\nthe plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally\ncompetent counsel\u2014or that it embodies a voluntary and\nintelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights. See\nibid. (\u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec\ntiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so under\nmined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult\u201d).\n   Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice re\ngarding exceptionally important collateral matters would\nnot deter or interfere with ongoing political and adminis\ntrative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to\nthe difficult problem posed by defendants who plead\nguilty without knowing of certain important collateral\nconsequences.\n   Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice re\ngarding the removal consequences of a conviction can give\nrise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court\u2019s\napproach, not require any upheaval in the law.

At least three Courts of Appeals\nhave held that affirmative misadvice on immigration\nmatters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel,\nat least in some circumstances.3 And several other Cir-\ncuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning\nnonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate\nthe Sixth Amendment even if those consequences might be\ndeemed \u201ccollateral.\u201d4 By contrast, it appears that no court\nof appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning\ncollateral consequences in general and removal in particu-\nlar can never give rise to ineffective assistance. In short,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See  United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015\u20131017 (CA9 2005);\nUnited States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan\nv.

KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower\nfederal courts charged with administering Strickland\nclearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Su\npreme Court\u2019s position goes too far.\n   In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the\nremoval consequences of a criminal conviction may consti\ntute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that\nthe Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense\ncounsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense\nattorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney\nshould advise the client that a criminal conviction may\nhave adverse consequences under the immigration laws\nand that the client should consult an immigration special\nist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting\nthe client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice\nwould significantly reduce the chance that the client\nwould plead guilty under a mistaken premise.\n                              III\n  In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be re\nquired to provide advice on immigration law, a complex\nspecialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal\ndefense attorney\u2019s expertise. On the other hand, any\ncompetent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the\nextraordinary importance that the risk of removal might\nhave in the client\u2019s determination whether to enter a\nguilty plea.    Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect\ninformation concerning the risk of removal can give rise to\nan ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not\nenough to satisfy counsel\u2019s duty to assist the client. In\nstead, an alien defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client\nthat a conviction may have immigration consequences,\nthat immigration law is a specialized field, that the attor\nney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client\nshould consult an immigration specialist if the client\nwants advice on that subject.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

KENTUCKY\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      KENTUCKY\n\n                        [March 31, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   In the best of all possible worlds, criminal defendants\ncontemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all\nserious collateral consequences of conviction, and surely\nought not to be misadvised. The Constitution, however, is\nnot an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect\nworld; and when we ignore its text in order to make it\nthat, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a\ntack hammer is needed.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer\n\u201cfor his defense\u201d against a \u201ccriminal prosecutio[n]\u201d\u2014not\nfor sound advice about the collateral consequences of\nconviction. For that reason, and for the practical reasons\nset forth in Part I of JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence, I dis\nsent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that the Sixth Amend\nment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concern\ning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.\nFor the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not\nbelieve that affirmative misadvice about those conse\nquences renders an attorney\u2019s assistance in defending\nagainst the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn im\nmigrant defendants that a conviction may render them\nremovable. Statutory provisions can remedy these con\ncerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing\n\f2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npermanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.\n                        *      *     *\n   The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and\nratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ\ncounsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See,\nUnited States v. Van Duzee, 140 U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W.\nBeaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28\u201329\n(1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amend\nment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defen\ndants at government expense, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU. S. 335, 344\u2013345 (1963), and that the right to \u201cthe assis\ntance of counsel\u201d includes the right to effective assistance,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). Even\nassuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the sig\nnificant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser\nextent the concurrence, would create. We have until today\nat least retained the Sixth Amendment\u2019s textual limita\ntion to criminal prosecutions. \u201c[W]e have held that \u2018de\nfence\u2019 means defense at trial, not defense in relation to\nother objectives that may be important to the accused.\u201d\nRothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).\nWe have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice\ndirectly related to defense against prosecution of the\ncharged offense\u2014advice at trial, of course, but also advice\nat postindictment interrogations and lineups, Massiah v.\nUnited States, 377 U. S. 201, 205\u2013206 (1964); United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 236\u2013238 (1967), and in\ngeneral advice at all phases of the prosecution where the\ndefendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone\nagainst the legally trained agents of the state, see Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). Not only have we\nnot required advice of counsel regarding consequences\ncollateral to prosecution, we have not even required coun\nsel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001).\n  There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the\nconstitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas\nbeyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution\nat hand\u2014to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce,\nthe higher sentence that conviction after trial might en\ntail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters\nfall within \u201cthe range of competence demanded of attor\nneys in criminal cases,\u201d McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S.\n759, 771 (1970). See id., at 769\u2013770 (describing the mat\nters counsel and client must consider in connection with a\ncontemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the\nlogic of the Court\u2019s opinion assumes, that once counsel is\nappointed all professional responsibilities of counsel\u2014even\nthose extending beyond defense against the prosecution\u2014\nbecome constitutional commands. Cf. Cobb, supra, at 171,\nn. 2; Moran, supra, at 430. Because the subject of the\nmisadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose\nPadilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the\nSixth Amendment has no application.\n  Adding to counsel\u2019s duties an obligation to advise about\na conviction\u2019s collateral consequences has no logical stop\nping-point. As the concurrence observes,\n    \u201c[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of\n    consequences other than conviction and sentencing,\n    including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of\n    the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits,\n    ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable dis\n    charge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or\n    professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are\n    \u2018serious,\u2019 . . . .\u201d Ante, at 2\u20133 (ALITO, J., concurring in\n    judgment).\nBut it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the\n\f4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame defect. The same indeterminacy, the same inability\nto know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to\nmisadvice. And the concurrence\u2019s suggestion that counsel\nmust warn defendants of potential removal consequences,\nsee ante, at 14\u201315\u2014what would come to be known as the\n\u201cPadilla warning\u201d\u2014cannot be limited to those conse\nquences except by judicial caprice. It is difficult to believe\nthat the warning requirement would not be extended, for\nexample, to the risk of heightened sentences in later fed\neral prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal\nAct, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e). We could expect years of elabora\ntion upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted\nby the defense bar\u2019s devising of ever-expanding categories\nof plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn\u2014not to\nmention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine\nwhether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning\nwas really given.\n   The concurrence\u2019s treatment of misadvice seems driven\nby concern about the voluntariness of Padilla\u2019s guilty plea.\nSee ante, at 12. But that concern properly relates to the\nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend\nments, not to the Sixth Amendment. See McCarthy v.\nUnited States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969); Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Padilla has not argued\nbefore us that his guilty plea was not knowing and volun\ntary. If that is, however, the true substance of his claim\n(and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can\naddress it on remand.1 But we should not smuggle the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1I\n     do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely\nprovide relief. We have indicated that awareness of \u201cdirect conse\nquences\u201d suffices for the validity of a guilty plea. See Brady, 397 U. S.,\nat 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the required colloquy\nbetween a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have\nsaid approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 49\u201350 (1995), does not mention\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nclaim into the Sixth Amendment.\n   The Court\u2019s holding prevents legislation that could solve\nthe problems addressed by today\u2019s opinions in a more\nprecise and targeted fashion. If the subject had not been\nconstitutionalized, legislation could specify which catego\nries of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecu\ntion invalidate plea agreements, what collateral conse\nquences counsel must bring to a defendant\u2019s attention, and\nwhat warnings must be given.2 Moreover, legislation\ncould provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice,\nor failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal\nconviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for\nretrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might\nprovide, for example, that the near-automatic removal\nwhich follows from certain criminal convictions will not\napply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea in\nduced by counsel\u2019s misadvice regarding removal conse\nquences. Or legislation might put the government to a\nchoice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant\nor forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in\nfavor of today\u2019s sledge hammer.\n   In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate\nassistance of counsel in defending against a pending\ncriminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitu\ntional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of\nbad advice to that well defined area.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncollateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of\nmisadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty\nplea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.\n  2 As the Court\u2019s opinion notes, ante, at 16\u201317, n. 15, many States\u2014\n\nincluding Kentucky\u2014already require that criminal defendants be\nwarned of potential removal consequences.\n\f"}

Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nPetitioners, shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent in\n  vestment adviser, filed this suit alleging that respondent violated\n  \u00a736(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes a\n  \u201cfiduciary duty [on investment advisers] with respect to the receipt of\n  compensation for services,\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b). Granting respon\n  dent summary judgment, the District Court concluded that petition\n  ers had not raised a triable issue of fact under the applicable stan\n  dard set forth in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.,\n  694 F. 2d 923, 928 (CA2): \u201c[T]he test is essentially whether the fee\n  schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have\n  been negotiated at arm\u2019s-length in light of all of the surrounding cir\n  cumstances. . . . To be guilty of a violation of \u00a736(b), . . . the adviser\n  must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no rea\n  sonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been\n  the product of arm\u2019s length bargaining.\u201d Rejecting the Gartenberg\n  standard, the Seventh Circuit panel affirmed based on different rea\n  soning.\nHeld: Based on \u00a736(b)\u2019s terms and the role that a shareholder action for\n breach of the investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary duty plays in the Act\u2019s\n overall structure, Gartenberg applied the correct standard. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) A consensus has developed regarding the standard Gartenberg\n set forth over 25 years ago: The standard has been adopted by other\n federal courts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s regu\n lations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors. Both\n petitioners and respondents generally endorse the Gartenberg ap\n proach but disagree in some respects about its meaning. Pp. 7\u20139.\n    (b) Section 36(b)\u2019s \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d phrase finds its meaning in Pep\n per v. Linton, 308 U. S. 295, 306\u2013307, where the Court discussed the\n\f2                 JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concept in the analogous bankruptcy context: \u201cThe essence of the test\n    is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries\n    the earmarks of an arm\u2019s length bargain. If it does not, equity will\n    set it aside.\u201d Gartenberg\u2019s approach fully incorporates this under\n    standing, insisting that all relevant circumstances be taken into ac\n    count and using the range of fees that might result from arm\u2019s-length\n    bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees. Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the statu\n    tory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protec\n    tions the Act affords investors. Under the Act, scrutiny of investment\n    adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board, see\n    Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 482, and shareholder suits under\n    \u00a736(b) are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for con\n    trolling adviser conflicts of interest, see Daily Income Fund, Inc. v.\n    Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 541. In recognition of the disinterested directors\u2019\n    role, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser\u2019s\n    compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed appropriate under\n    all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). It may be inferred from this\n    formulation that (1) a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment\n    may be appropriate in some instances, and (2) the appropriate meas\n    ure of deference varies depending on the circumstances. Gartenberg\n    heeds these precepts. See 694 F. 2d, at 930. Pp. 11\u201312.\n       (d) The Court resolves the parties\u2019 disagreements on several impor\n    tant questions. First, since the Act requires consideration of all rele\n    vant factors, \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2), courts must give comparisons between\n    the fees an investment adviser charges a captive mutual fund and\n    the fees it charges its independent clients the weight they merit in\n    light of the similarities and differences between the services the cli\n    ents in question require. In doing so, the Court must be wary of in\n    apt comparisons based on significant differences between those ser\n    vices and must be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure\n    fee parity between the two types of clients. However, courts should\n    not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged mutual funds\n    by other advisers, which may not result from arm\u2019s-length negotia\n    tions. Finally, a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment adviser\u2019s fiduci\n    ary duty must take into account both procedure and substance.\n    Where disinterested directors consider all of the relevant factors,\n    their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to\n    considerable weight, even if the court might weigh the factors differ\n    ently. Cf. Lasker, 441 U. S., at 486. In contrast, where the board\u2019s\n    process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information,\n    the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome.

P. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 30, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider in this case what a mutual fund share\nholder must prove in order to show that a mutual fund\ninvestment adviser breached the \u201cfiduciary duty with\nrespect to the receipt of compensation for services\u201d that is\nimposed by \u00a736(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (hereinafter \u00a736(b)).\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), 54 Stat.\n789, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u20131 et seq., regulates investment com\npanies, including mutual funds. \u201cA mutual fund is a pool\nof assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securi\nties, and belonging to the individual investors holding\nshares in the fund.\u201d Burks v. Lasker, 441 U. S. 471, 480\n(1979). The following arrangements are typical. A sepa\nrate entity called an investment adviser creates the mu\ntual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See\nKamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 93\n(1991); Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U. S. 523, 536\n(1984); Burks, 441 U. S., at 480\u2013481. The adviser selects\n\f2            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe fund\u2019s directors, manages the fund\u2019s investments, and\nprovides other services. See id., at 481. Because of the\nrelationship between a mutual fund and its investment\nadviser, the fund often \u201c \u2018cannot, as a practical matter\nsever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the\nforces of arm\u2019s-length bargaining do not work in the mu\ntual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other\nsectors of the American economy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).\n   \u201cCongress adopted the [Investment Company Act of\n1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse\ninherent in the structure of investment companies.\u201d Daily\nIncome Fund, 464 U. S., at 536 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a\nfund and its investment adviser was \u201cfraught with poten\ntial conflicts of interest,\u201d the Act created protections for\nmutual fund shareholders. Id., at 536\u2013538 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted); Burks, supra, at 482\u2013483. Among\nother things, the Act required that no more than 60 per\ncent of a fund\u2019s directors could be affiliated with the ad\nviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by\nthe directors and the shareholders of the fund. See \u00a7\u00a710,\n15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.\n   The growth of mutual funds in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s\nprompted studies of the 1940 Act\u2019s effectiveness in protect\ning investors. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 537\u2013\n538. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identi\nfied problems relating to the independence of investment\ncompany boards and the compensation received by in\nvestment advisers. See ibid. In response to such con\ncerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered\nshareholder protection in two primary ways.\n   First, the amendments strengthened the \u201ccornerstone\u201d\nof the Act\u2019s efforts to check conflicts of interest, the inde\npendence of mutual fund boards of directors, which nego\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

The amendments required that no more than 60\npercent of a fund\u2019s directors be \u201cpersons who are inter\nested persons,\u201d e.g., that they have no interest in or affilia\ntion with the investment adviser.1 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u2013\n10(a); \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at\n538. These board members are given \u201ca host of special\nresponsibilities.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482\u2013483. In par\nticular, they must \u201creview and approve the contracts of the\ninvestment adviser\u201d annually, id., at 483, and a majority\nof these directors must approve an adviser\u2019s compensation,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c). Second, \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of\nthe Act imposed upon investment advisers a \u201cfiduciary\nduty\u201d with respect to compensation received from a mu\ntual fund, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b), and granted individual\ninvestors a private right of action for breach of that duty,\nibid.\n   The \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d standard contained in \u00a736(b) repre\nsented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the\n1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment\nadviser fees under state law were required to meet \u201ccom\nmon-law standards of corporate waste, under which an\nunreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 An  \u201caffiliated person\u201d includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or\nholds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the in\nvestment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns,\ncontrols, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of\nthe securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, con\ntrolled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an\nofficer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment\nadviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment\nadviser\u2019s board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated\ninvestment adviser. See \u00a780a\u20132(a)(3). The Act defines \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath\nof people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested\npersons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the\ncompany, and interested broker-dealers. \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19).\n\f4            JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt deemed it \u2018unconscionable\u2019 or \u2018shocking,\u2019 \u201d and \u201csecu\nrity holders challenging adviser fees under the [Invest\nment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross\nabuse of trust.\u201d Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 540,\nn. 12. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the\nSEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the\nCommission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was\nnot \u201creasonable\u201d and to intervene in any similar action\nbrought by or on behalf of an investment company. Id., at\n538. This approach was included in a bill that passed the\nHouse. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967); see\nalso S. 1659, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a78(d) (1967). Industry\nrepresentatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing\nthat it \u201cmight in essence provide the Commission with\nratemaking authority.\u201d Daily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at\n538.\n   The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted \u201ca\ndifferent method of testing management compensation,\u201d\nid., at 539 (quoting S. Rep., at 5 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)), that was more favorable to shareholders\nthan the previously available remedies but that did not\npermit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court\nfor \u201creasonableness.\u201d This is the fiduciary duty standard\nin \u00a736(b).\n                            B\n  Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual\nfunds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P., an\ninvestment adviser. Petitioners filed this action in the\nNorthern District of Illinois pursuant to \u00a736(b) seeking\ndamages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agree\nments between Harris Associates and the mutual funds.\nThe complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated\n\u00a736(b) by charging fees that were \u201cdisproportionate to the\nservices rendered\u201d and \u201cnot within the range of what\nwould have been negotiated at arm\u2019s length in light of all\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe surrounding circumstances.\u201d App. 52.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nHarris Associates. Applying the standard adopted in\nGartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694\nF. 2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners\nhad failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to \u201cwhether the\nfees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they\ncould not have been the result of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed\nthat it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with\nthose that Harris Associates charged its other clients. Id.,\nat 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as com\nparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to\nsimilar mutual funds, the Court held that it could not\nreasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside\nthe range that could have been the product of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining. Id., at 29a\u201332a.\n   A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on differ\nent reasoning, explicitly \u201cdisapprov[ing] the Gartenberg\napproach.\u201d 527 F. 3d 627, 632 (2008). Looking to trust\nlaw, the panel noted that, while a trustee \u201cowes an obliga\ntion of candor in negotiation,\u201d a trustee, at the time of the\ncreation of a trust, \u201cmay negotiate in his own interest and\naccept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to\npay.\u201d Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242,\nand Comment f)). The panel thus reasoned that \u201c[a] fidu\nciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must\nmake full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject\nto a cap on compensation.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632. In the\npanel\u2019s view, the amount of an adviser\u2019s compensation\nwould be relevant only if the compensation were \u201cso un\nusual\u201d as to give rise to an inference \u201cthat deceit must\nhave occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision\nhave abdicated.\u201d Ibid.\n   The panel argued that this understanding of \u00a736(b) is\nconsistent with the forces operating in the contemporary\n\f6               JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmutual fund market. Noting that \u201c[t]oday thousands of\nmutual funds compete,\u201d the panel concluded that \u201csophis\nticated investors\u201d shop for the funds that produce the best\noverall results, \u201cmov[e] their money elsewhere\u201d when fees\nare \u201cexcessive in relation to the results,\u201d and thus \u201ccreate\na competitive pressure\u201d that generally keeps fees low. Id.,\nat 633\u2013634. The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground\nthat it \u201crelies too little on markets.\u201d 527 F. 3d, at 632.\nAnd the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the\nfees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the\nfees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients,\nobserving that \u201c[d]ifferent clients call for different com\nmitments of time\u201d and that costs, such as research, that\nmay benefit several categories of clients \u201cmake it hard to\ndraw inferences from fee levels.\u201d Id., at 634.\n   The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an\nequally divided vote. 537 F. 3d 728 (2008). The dissent\nfrom the denial of rehearing argued that the panel\u2019s rejec\ntion of Gartenberg was based \u201cmainly on an economic\nanalysis that is ripe for reexamination.\u201d 537 F. 3d, at 730\n(opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent\nexpressed concern that Harris Associates charged \u201cits\ncaptive funds more than twice what it charges independ\nent funds,\u201d and the dissent questioned whether high ad\nviser fees actually drive investors away. Id., at 731.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\nCourts of Appeals over the proper standard under \u00a736(b).2\n556 U.

Assets under management increased from\n$38.2 billion in 1966 to over $9.6 trillion in 2008. The\nnumber of mutual fund investors grew from 3.5 million in\n1965 to 92 million in 2008, and there are now more than\n9,000 open- and closed-end funds.3\n  During this time, the standard for an investment ad\nviser\u2019s fiduciary duty has remained an open question in\nour Court, but, until the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision below,\nsomething of a consensus had developed regarding the\nstandard set forth over 25 years ago in Gartenberg, supra.\nThe Gartenberg standard has been adopted by other fed\neral courts,4 and \u201c[t]he SEC\u2019s regulations have recognized,\nand formalized, Gartenberg-like factors.\u201d Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 23.

P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to compensation but concluded that \u201cthe test is\nessentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge\nwithin the range of what would have been negotiated at\narm\u2019s-length in the light of all of the surrounding circum\nstances.\u201d 694 F. 2d, at 928. The Second Circuit elabo\nrated that, \u201c[t]o be guilty of a violation of \u00a736(b), . . . the\nadviser-manager must charge a fee that is so dispropor\ntionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to\nthe services rendered and could not have been the product\nof arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d Ibid. \u201cTo make this determi\nnation,\u201d the Court stated, \u201call pertinent facts must be\nweighed,\u201d id., at 929, and the Court specifically mentioned\n\u201cthe adviser-manager\u2019s cost in providing the service, . . .\nthe extent to which the adviser-manager realizes econo\nmies of scale as the fund grows larger, and the volume of\norders which must be processed by the manager.\u201d Id., at\n930.5 Observing that competition among advisers for the\nbusiness of managing a fund may be \u201cvirtually non\nexistent,\u201d the Court rejected the suggestion that \u201cthe\nprincipal factor to be considered in evaluating a fee\u2019s\nfairness is the price charged by other similar advisers to\nfunds managed by them,\u201d although the Court did not\nsuggest that this factor could not be \u201ctaken into account.\u201d\nId., at 929. The Court likewise rejected the \u201cargument\nthat the lower fees charged by investment advisers to\nlarge pension funds should be used as a criterion for de\ntermining fair advisory fees for money market funds,\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Other factors cited by the Gartenberg court include (1) the nature\n\nand quality of the services provided to the fund and shareholders; (2)\nthe profitability of the fund to the adviser; (3) any \u201cfall-out financial\nbenefits,\u201d those collateral benefits that accrue to the adviser because of\nits relationship with the mutual fund; (4) comparative fee structure\n(meaning a comparison of the fees with those paid by similar funds);\nand (5) the independence, expertise, care, and conscientiousness of the\nboard in evaluating adviser compensation. 694 F. 2d, at 929\u2013932\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

A money market\nfund often invests in short-term money market securities, such as\nshort-term securities of the United States Government or its agencies,\nbank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Investors can\ninvest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor\u2019s\nperspective, the fund resembles an investment \u201cmore like a bank\naccount than [a] traditional investment in securities.\u201d Id., at 925.\n  7 Section 36 (b) provides as follows:\n\n  \u201c[T]he investment adviser of a registered investment company shall\nbe deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of com\npensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by\nsuch registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof,\nto such investment adviser.\u201d 84 Stat. 1429 (codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a780a\u201335(b)).\n\f10           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nidentified the wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the\nstandard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negoti\nate the trustee\u2019s fee at the time of the creation of a trust,\npetitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trus\ntee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for\nPetitioners 20\u201323, 35\u201337. A compensation agreement\nreached at that time, they point out, \u201c \u2018will not bind the\nbeneficiary\u2019 if either \u2018the trustee failed to make a full\ndisclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement\u2019 \u201d\nwhich he knew or should have known or if the agreement\nis unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restate\nment (Second) of Trusts \u00a7242, Comment i). Respondent,\non the other hand, contends that the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d is\nnot exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means\ndifferent things in different contexts, and that there is no\nreason to believe that \u00a736(b) incorporates the specific\nmeaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Re\nspondent 34\u201336.\n   We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In\nPepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295 (1939), we discussed the\nmeaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that\nis analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to\ntrust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy\ncourt could disallow a dominant or controlling share\nholder\u2019s claim for compensation against a bankrupt corpo\nration. Dominant or controlling shareholders, we held, are\n\u201cfiduciar[ies]\u201d whose \u201cpowers are powers [held] in trust.\u201d\nId., at 306. We then explained:\n     \u201cTheir dealings with the corporation are subjected to\n     rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or\n     engagements with the corporation is challenged the\n     burden is on the director or stockholder not only to\n     prove the good faith of the transaction but also to\n     show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the\n     corporation and those interested therein. . . .

If it does not, equity will set it\n    aside.\u201d Id., at 306\u2013307 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted); see also Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining\n    Co., 254 U. S. 590, 599 (1921) (standard of fiduciary\n    duty for interested directors).\nWe believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of\nthe phrase \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d in \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The\nInvestment Company Act modifies this duty in a signifi\ncant way: it shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to\nthe party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1), to\nshow that the fee is outside the range that arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining would produce.\n   The Gartenberg approach fully incorporates this under\nstanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in Pepper and\nreflects \u00a736(b)(1)\u2019s imposition of the burden on the plain\ntiff. As noted, Gartenberg insists that all relevant circum\nstances be taken into account, see 694 F. 2d, at 929, as\ndoes \u00a736(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (\u201c[A]pproval by the board of\ndirectors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court\nas is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances \u201d\n(emphasis added)). And Gartenberg uses the range of fees\nthat might result from arm\u2019s-length bargaining as the\nbenchmark for reviewing challenged fees.\n                              2\n  Gartenberg\u2019s approach also reflects \u00a736(b)\u2019s place in the\nstatutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the\nother protections that the Act affords investors.\n  Under the Act, scrutiny of investment adviser compen\nsation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the \u201ccor\nnerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest\nwithin mutual funds.\u201d Burks, 441 U. S., at 482. The Act\ninterposes disinterested directors as \u201cindependent watch\ndogs\u201d of the relationship between a mutual fund and its\n\f12           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadviser. Id., at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo provide these directors with the information needed to\njudge whether an adviser\u2019s compensation is excessive, the\nAct requires advisers to furnish all information \u201creasona\nbly . . . necessary to evaluate the terms\u201d of the adviser\u2019s\ncontract, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201315(c), and gives the SEC the\nauthority to enforce that requirement. See \u00a780a\u201341.\nBoard scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder\nsuits under \u00a736(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing\nbut independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts. See\nDaily Income Fund, 464 U. S., at 541 (Congress intended\nfor \u00a736(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser con\ntracts to act as \u201cindependent checks on excessive fees\u201d);\nKamen, 500 U. S., at 108 (\u201cCongress added \u00a736(b) to the\n[Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders\nshould not have to rely solely on the fund\u2019s directors to\nassure reasonable adviser fees, notwithstanding the in\ncreased disinterestedness of the board\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n  In recognition of the role of the disinterested directors,\nthe Act instructs courts to give board approval of an ad\nviser\u2019s compensation \u201csuch consideration . . . as is deemed\nappropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2).\nCf. Burks, 441 U. S., at 485 (\u201c[I]t would have been para\ndoxical for Congress to have been willing to rely largely\nupon [boards of directors as] \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to protect share\nholder interests and yet, where the \u2018watchdogs\u2019 have done\nprecisely that, require that they be totally muzzled\u201d).\n  From this formulation, two inferences may be drawn.\nFirst, a measure of deference to a board\u2019s judgment may\nbe appropriate in some instances. Second, the appro\npriate measure of deference varies depending on the\ncircumstances.\n  Gartenberg heeds these precepts. Gartenberg advises\nthat \u201cthe expertise of the independent trustees of a fund,\nwhether they are fully informed about all facts bearing on\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe [investment adviser\u2019s] service and fee, and the extent\nof care and conscientiousness with which they perform\ntheir duties are important factors to be considered in\ndeciding whether they and the [investment adviser] are\nguilty of a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of \u00a736(b).\u201d\n694 F. 2d, at 930.\n                             III\n   While both parties in this case endorse the basic Gar\ntenberg approach, they disagree on several important\nquestions that warrant discussion.\n   The first concerns comparisons between the fees that an\nadviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees that it\ncharges its independent clients. As noted, the Gartenberg\ncourt rejected a comparison between the fees that the\nadviser in that case charged a money market fund and the\nfees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F. 2d, at 930, n. 3\n(noting the \u201c[t]he nature and extent of the services re\nquired by each type of fund differ sharply\u201d). Petitioners\ncontend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for\nPetitioners 30\u201331, but respondent disagrees. Brief for\nRespondent 38\u201344. Since the Act requires consideration of\nall relevant factors, 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2); see also\n\u00a780a\u201315(c), we do not think that there can be any cate\ngorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees charged\ndifferent types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra,\nat 537 (discussing concern with investment advisers\u2019\npractice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to\ntheir other clients). Instead, courts may give such com\nparisons the weight that they merit in light of the simi\nlarities and differences between the services that the\nclients in question require, but courts must be wary of\ninapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may\nbe significant differences between the services provided by\nan investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it pro\nvides to a pension fund which are attributable to the\n\f14              JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual\nfund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more\nburdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher\nmarketing costs. 527 F. 3d, at 634 (\u201cDifferent clients call\nfor different commitments of time\u201d). If the services ren\ndered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not\nprobative, then courts must reject such a comparison.\nEven if the services provided and fees charged to an inde\npendent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that\nthe Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between\nmutual funds and institutional clients contrary to peti\ntioners\u2019 contentions. See id., at 631. (\u201cPlaintiffs maintain\nthat a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more\nthan its independent clients\u201d).8\n   By the same token, courts should not rely too heavily on\ncomparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other\nadvisers. These comparisons are problematic because\nthese fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of\nnegotiations conducted at arm\u2019s length. See 537 F. 3d, at\n731\u2013732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc); Gartenberg, supra, at 929 (\u201cCompetition between\nmoney market funds for shareholder business does not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Comparisons with fees charged to institutional clients, therefore,\n\nwill not \u201cdoo[m] [a]ny [f]und to [t]rial.\u201d Brief for Respondent 49; see\nalso Strougo v. BEA Assocs., 188 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (SDNY 2002)\n(suggesting that fee comparisons, where permitted, might produce a\ntriable issue). First, plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that fees are\nbeyond the range of arm\u2019s-length bargaining. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(1). Second, a\nshowing of relevance requires courts to assess any disparity in fees in\nlight of the different markets for advisory services. Only where plain\ntiffs have shown a large disparity in fees that cannot be explained by\nthe different services in addition to other evidence that the fee is\noutside the arm\u2019s-length range will trial be appropriate. Cf. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 30a; see also In re AllianceBernstein Mut.

S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport an inference that competition must therefore also\nexist between [investment advisers] for fund business.\nThe former may be vigorous even though the latter is\nvirtually non-existent\u201d).\n   Finally, a court\u2019s evaluation of an investment adviser\u2019s\nfiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and\nsubstance. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b)(2) (requiring defer\nence to board\u2019s consideration \u201cas is deemed appropriate\nunder all the circumstances\u201d); cf. Daily Income Fund, 464\nU. S., at 541 (\u201cCongress intended security holder and SEC\nactions under \u00a736(b), on the one hand, and directorial\napproval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as inde\npendent checks on excessive fees\u201d). Where a board\u2019s proc\ness for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser\ncompensation is robust, a reviewing court should afford\ncommensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining\nprocess. See Burks, 441 U. S., at 484 (unaffiliated direc\ntors serve as \u201cindependent watchdogs\u201d). Thus, if the\ndisinterested directors considered the relevant factors,\ntheir decision to approve a particular fee agreement is\nentitled to considerable weight, even if a court might\nweigh the factors differently. Cf. id., at 485. This is not to\ndeny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated\nby a board in possession of all relevant information, but\nsuch a determination must be based on evidence that the\nfee \u201cis so disproportionately large that it bears no reason\nable relationship to the services rendered and could not\nhave been the product of arm\u2019s-length bargaining.\u201d Gar\ntenberg, supra, at 928.\n   In contrast, where the board\u2019s process was deficient or\nthe adviser withheld important information, the court\nmust take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an\ninvestment adviser fails to disclose material information\nto the board, greater scrutiny is justified because the\nwithheld information might have hampered the board\u2019s\nability to function as \u201can independent check upon the\n\f16           JONES v. HARRIS ASSOCIATES L. P.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanagement.\u201d Burks, supra, at 484 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \u201cSection 36(b) is sharply focused on the\nquestion of whether the fees themselves were excessive.\u201d\nMigdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int\u2019l, Inc., 248 F. 3d 321,\n328 (CA4 2001); see also 15 U. S. C. \u00a780a\u201335(b) (imposing\na \u201cfiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensa\ntion for services, or of payments of a material nature\u201d\n(emphasis added)). But an adviser\u2019s compliance or non\ncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that\nmust be considered in calibrating the degree of deference\nthat is due a board\u2019s decision to approve an adviser\u2019s fees.\n   It is also important to note that the standard for fiduci\nary breach under \u00a736(b) does not call for judicial second\nguessing of informed board decisions. See Daily Income\nFund, supra, at 538; see also Burks, 441 U. S., at 483\n(\u201cCongress consciously chose to address the conflict-of\ninterest problem through the Act\u2019s independent-directors\nsection, rather than through more drastic remedies\u201d).\n\u201c[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some re\nstraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinter\nested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transac\ntions with the investment adviser,\u201d but they do not\nsuggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disin\nterested directors apprised of all relevant information,\nwithout additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm\u2019s\nlength range. Id., at 481. In reviewing compensation\nunder \u00a736(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in\na precise calculation of fees representative of arm\u2019s-length\nbargaining. See 527 F. 3d, at 633 (\u201cJudicial price-setting\ndoes not accompany fiduciary duties\u201d). As recounted\nabove, Congress rejected a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement\nthat was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting\nresponsibilities. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538\u2013\n540. Congress\u2019 approach recognizes that courts are not\nwell suited to make such precise calculations. Cf. General\nMotors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.

I write separately because I would not\nshortchange the Court\u2019s effort by describing it as affirma\ntion of the \u201cGartenberg standard.\u201d Ante, at 7, 17.\n   The District Court and Court of Appeals in Gartenberg\ncreated that standard, which emphasizes fee \u201cfairness\u201d\nand proportionality, 694 F. 2d, at 929, in a manner that\ncould be read to permit the equivalent of the judicial rate\nregulation the Gartenberg opinions disclaim, based on the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940\u2019s \u201ctortuous\u201d legislative\nhistory and a handful of extrastatutory policy and market\nconsiderations, id., at 928; see also id., at 926\u2013927, 929\u2013\n931; Gartenberg v.

Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided March 30, 2010\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and\n  private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or\n  fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam\n  actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions\n  in, inter alia, \u201ca congressional, administrative, or Government Ac\n  counting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.\u201d 31\n  U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two\n  North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding\n  and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.\n  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in\n  volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible\n  fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po\n  tential irregularities in the contracts\u2019 administration. Subsequently,\n  Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti\n  tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,\n  knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.\n  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be\n  cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega\n  tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held\n  were \u201cadministrative\u201d reports under the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar.\n  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis\n  trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.\nHeld: The reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits, and investiga\n tions in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo\n cal sources as well as federal sources.

The\n    language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) The FCA\u2019s plain text does not limit \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\n    sources. Because that term modifies \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\n    tigation\u201d in a provision about \u201cthe public disclosure\u201d of fraud on the\n    United States, it is most naturally read to describe government\n    agency activities.

The interpretive maxim\n    noscitur a sociis\u2014\u201ca word may be known by the company it keeps,\u201d\n    Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519\u2014does not\n    support the Fourth Circuit\u2019s more limited view. In Category 2, \u201cad\n    ministrative\u201d is sandwiched between the federal terms \u201ccongres\n    sional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d but these items are too few and too disparate to\n    qualify as \u201ca string of statutory terms,\u201d S.

S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so\n    ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating \u201cadministrative\u201d within the\n    public disclosure bar\u2019s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate\n    gory 2\u2019s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate\n    gory 1 (\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing\u201d) and Category 3\n    (\u201cnews media\u201d) that are generally understood to include nonfederal\n    sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (\u201cadministrative\u201d)\n    that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to\n    adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi\n    legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis\n    lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely\n    to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state\n    and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The\n    FCA\u2019s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question\n    whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.\n    And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in\n    \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state\n    administrative sources.

How exactly the statute\n    came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub\n    stantive changes\u2014including the introduction of \u201cadministrative\u201d in\n    Category 2\u2014were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,\n    as \u201ctechnical\u201d amendments.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a73729\u20133733, has authorized both\nthe Attorney General and private qui tam relators to\nrecover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims\nfor payment to the United States. The Act now contains a\nprovision barring qui tam actions based upon the public\ndisclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci\nfied sources. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is\nwhether the reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d reports, audits,\nand investigations in that provision encompasses disclo\nsures made in state and local sources as well as federal\nsources. We hold that it does.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Pro\ntection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.

The legislation makes no\nmention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to\npending cases given that it eliminates petitioners\u2019 claimed defense to a\nqui tam suit.

Throughout this opinion, we use the present\n\f2    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n   In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North\nCarolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to\nperform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf\nfered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed\nto shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent\nKaren T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the\nGraham County Soil and Conservation District, a special\npurpose government body that had been delegated partial\nresponsibility for coordinating and performing the reme\ndiation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection\nwith this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi\ncials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and\nhad a meeting with, agents of the USDA.\n   Graham County officials began an investigation. An\naccounting firm hired by the county performed an audit\nand, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified\nseveral potential irregularities in the county\u2019s administra\ntion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro\nlina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural\nResources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying\nsimilar problems. The USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General\neventually issued a third report that contained additional\nfindings.\n   In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition\ners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and\nWater Conservation Districts and a number of local and\nfederal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by\nknowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant\nto the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners\nretaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation\nof those false claims. Following this Court\u2019s review of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was\n\nargued. \n\n\f                       Cite as: 559 U.

Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the\nCourt of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as\ntime barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the\nDistrict Court subsequently dismissed Wilson\u2019s qui tam\naction for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a\u2013\n105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute\nthat her action was based upon allegations publicly dis\nclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at\n95a\u201398a.

The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction\nstripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court\nof Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300\u2013301, we have inserted\nArabic numerals to identify these categories:\n       \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin\n       istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra\n       tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,\n       hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news\n       media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney\n       General or the person bringing the action is an origi\n       nal source[4] of the information.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (foot\n       note omitted).\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective \u201cad\nministrative\u201d in the second category (Category 2): whether\nit embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as\nrespondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures\nmade in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 See,\n         e.g., Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v.

S. 765 (2000)\n(holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions).\n   4 A separate statutory provision defines an \u201coriginal source\u201d as \u201can\n\nindividual who has direct and independent knowledge of the informa\ntion on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided\nthe information to the Government before filing an action under this\nsection which is based on the information.\u201d 31 U.

Although there is\nsome overlap among the three types of argument, it is\nuseful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.\n                              III\n    The term \u201cadministrative\u201d \u201cmay, in various contexts,\nbear a range of related meanings,\u201d Chandler v. Judicial\nCouncil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to\nprivate bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When\nused to modify the nouns \u201creport, hearing, audit, or inves\ntigation,\u201d in the context of a statutory provision about \u201cthe\npublic disclosure\u201d of fraud on the United States, the term\nis most naturally read to describe the activities of govern\nmental agencies. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cadministration,\u201d \u201c[i]n\npublic law, [as] the practical management and direction of\nthe executive department and its agencies\u201d). Given that\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is not itself modified by \u201cfederal,\u201d there is\nno immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the\nactivities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)\nfrom its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, \u201cthe\nstatute by its express terms does not limit its reach to\nfederal administrative reports or investigations.\u201d 528\nF. 3d, at 301. \u201c[T]here is nothing inherently federal about\nthe word \u2018administrative,\u2019 and Congress did not define the\nterm in the FCA.\u201d Id., at 302.\n    The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cadministrative\u201d\nnevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its\napplication of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.\nSee id., at 302\u2013305. This maxim, literally translated as\n\u201c \u2018it is known by its associates,\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s 1160, counsels\n\f6       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v.

United\nStates, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this\nlitigation acknowledge that the terms \u201ccongressional\u201d and\n\u201c[GAO]\u201d are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative\nBranch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a\nfederal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren\nCo. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.\n370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368\n(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201cthe placement\nof \u2018administrative\u2019 squarely in the middle of a list of obvi\nously federal sources strongly suggests that \u2018administra\ntive\u2019 should likewise be restricted to federal administrative\nreports, hearings, audits, or investigations.\u201d 528 F. 3d, at\n302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what\nwe might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.\nBoth courts \u201c \u2018f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of\nthis provision intended the word \u201cadministrative\u201d to refer\nto both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched\nbetween modifiers which are unquestionably federal in\ncharacter.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy\nv. County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).\n   We find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive.

We\ndisagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase \u201ccon\ngressional, administrative, or GAO\u201d is not as cohesive as the phrase\n\u201cexploration, discovery, or prospecting.\u201d That is one reason why nosci\ntur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in\nthis case.

We agree with petitioners, however, that all of\nthe sources listed in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:\nspecifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui\ntam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar\u2019s gram\nmatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify\ning to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it\ndoes not follow that we should treat these categories as\nislands unto themselves. Courts have a \u201cduty to construe\nstatutes, not isolated provisions.\u201d Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).\n   When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure\nbar, the case for limiting \u201cadministrative\u201d to federal\nsources becomes significantly weaker. The \u201cnews media\u201d\nreferenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.\nThe Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and\ncertain private outlets have a national focus; but no one\ncontends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.\nThere is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the\n\u201ccriminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]\u201d listed in\nCategory 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201ccommon feature\u201d at all, post, at 4\u2014apart from a governmental conno\ntation.

See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324;\nBrief for United States 25\u201326. No court has ever taken\nsuch a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing\ncases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh\nCircuits and stating that \u201c[t]he courts have easily con\ncluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings\u201d);\nSylvia \u00a711:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The\narguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into\nCategory 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history\nand policy; they find no support in the statute\u2019s text.\n  Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to\na bird\u2019s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General\nalso maintain that the \u201cexclusively federal focus\u201d of the\nFCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to\nencompass nonfederal sources.

But so does every other federal statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnarrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure\nstatus to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state\nand local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public\ndisclosure status to a formal public report of a state government\nagency\u201d).\n  10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent\n\nasserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.\nCalifornia, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and\nrejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.\nBrief for Respondent 23\u201324.

Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh\nCircuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and\nDunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on\nnotice of the possibility that \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal\nsources.\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

In any event, the\n\u201cfederal focus\u201d of the statute, as a whole, does not shine\nlight on the specific question whether the public disclosure\nbar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of\n\u201cpublic disclosure\u201d\u2014not Federal Government creation or\nreceipt\u2014that is the touchstone of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A).\n   Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last\nargument grounded in the statutory text: It would be\nanomalous, they say, for state and local administrative\nreports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla\ntive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for\nUnited States 15\u201316. Yet neither respondent nor the\nSolicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners\nand their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar\nwas enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla\ntures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing\nfederally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36\u2013\n39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8\u201313. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern\nment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and\nto provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.\nWhether or not state legislative sources should have been\nincluded in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car\nries no clear implications for the status of state adminis\ntrative sources.\n   In sum, although the term \u201cadministrative\u201d may be\nsandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 On its face, \u00a73733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed\n\neral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it\ndoes, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil\ninvestigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.\nSee Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31\u201332.\n\f12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be\ntween phrases that have been generally understood to\ninclude nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in\nCategory 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of\nour inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the\nnoscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of\nAppeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with\nwhich \u201cadministrative\u201d keeps company in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\nendow it with an exclusively federal character.\n                             IV\n  As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources\nfrom which a relator could acquire the information to\nbring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U.

Id., at 545\u2013548; see id., at 545 (\u201cEven if, as the gov\nernment suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing\nto the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to\naccomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was\npassed\u201d). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by\namending the statute to preclude qui tam actions \u201cbased\nupon evidence or information in the possession of the\nUnited States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in\n\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(A) as \u201cclauses.\u201d See 528 F. 3d, at 300\u2013305. Were they in\nfact clauses rather than prepositional phrases, reliance on noscitur a\nsociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using\nthat term, Watson v.

Congress apparently concluded\nthat a total bar on qui tam actions based on information\nalready in the Government\u2019s possession thwarted a sig\nnificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather\nthan simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how\never, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in\nan effort to strike a balance between encouraging private\npersons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits\nsuch as the one in Hess. How exactly \u00a73730(e)(4) came to\nstrike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid\nerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary\nCommittees each reported bills that contained very differ\nent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in\nthe Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not\n\f14    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

See S. Rep., at 42\u201343 (text of\nproposed \u00a73730(e)(4)).13\n   In respondent and her amici\u2019s view, this background\ncounsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of\n\u201cadministrative\u201d for three separate reasons. First, the\ndrafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that\nCongress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of\nthe 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov\nernment knowledge bar, and \u201c[c]onstruing [\u00a73730(e)(4)(A)]\nas limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers\nCongress\u2019s purpose \u2018to encourage more private enforce\nment suits.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,\nat 23\u201324). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed\nings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General\nwith a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA\naction based on revelations made therein, the Attorney\nGeneral is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in\nstate proceedings. Respondent and her amici further\nmaintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal\nsources in Category 2, as local governments would then be\nable to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis\ncretely disclosing evidence of fraud in \u201cpublic\u201d reports.14\n   These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but\nthey do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft\ning history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques\ntions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See   also H.

Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence\nby a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful\nweight, Senator Grassley\u2019s remark merely begs the ques\ntion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether\nthe \u201cother governmental bodies\u201d may be state or local\nbodies. It also turns on a term, \u201cGovernment\u201d with a\ncapital \u201cG,\u201d that does not appear in the codified version of\nthe public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently\nrevised in numerous respects prior to passage.\n   There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record\nthat squarely corroborates respondent\u2019s reading of the\nstatute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986\namendments to the Attorney General in 1999.

Bornstein, 423 U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 See Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447\n\nU. S. 102, 118 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.

See Brief\nfor Respondent 30\u201333; Brief for United States 14\u201315; Brief for Taxpay\ners Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28\u201329. Yet while\n\u201cthere is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in\ntandem with the FCA,\u201d Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the\nPFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no\nexplicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category\n2\u2019s reference to \u201cadministrative\u201d sources to the same set of agencies.\nThe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated\nin the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer\nence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are\naware, articulated any such intent.\n\f18    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n303, 310 (1976), there is no \u201cevident legislative purpose\u201d to\nguide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.\n                              V\n   Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their\ncase that petitioners\u2019 reading of the statute will lead to\nresults that Congress could not have intended. Their\nargument rests on an empirical proposition: \u201cWhile federal\ninquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De\npartment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and\nlocal reports and investigations never come to the atten\ntion of federal authorities.\u201d Brief for United States 22; see\nalso 528 F. 3d, at 306 (\u201cBecause the federal government is\nunlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a\nlarge number of fraudulent claims against the government\nwould go unremedied without the financial incentives\noffered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA\u201d). This\nproposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.\nNumerous federal investigations may be occurring at any\ngiven time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn\nabout their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about\nquite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the\ninquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state\nprogram financed in part by federal dollars, such as the\nprogram at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the\nAttorney General a typical state or local source will be, as\ncompared to a federal source, is an open question. And it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern\n\nments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See\n31 U.

The statutory touchstone,\nonce again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been\n\u201cpublic[ly] disclos[ed],\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), not whether they\nhave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument also gives insufficient weight to\nCongress\u2019 decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo\nsures \u201cfrom the news media.\u201d Ibid. Because there was no\nsuch bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a\njurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion\nthat the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded\nintent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.\nAnd since the \u201cnews media\u201d include a large number of\nlocal newspapers and radio stations, this category likely\ndescribes a multitude of sources that would seldom come\nto the attention of the Attorney General.\n   As for respondent and her amici\u2019s concern that local\ngovernments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil\nity \u201cthrough careful, low key \u2018disclosures\u2019 \u201d of potential\nfraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu\nlation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any\nsuch disclosure would not immunize the local government\nfrom FCA liability in an action brought by the United\nStates, see Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.\n457, 478 (2007)\u2014and to the contrary it could tip off the\nAttorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It\nseems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view\nwhen they assert that, \u201c[g]iven the fact that the submis\nsion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen\ndant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam\nages and attorneys\u2019 fees, no rational entity would prepare\na report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of\ncutting off qui tam actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;\nsee also United States ex rel.

Today\u2019s ruling merely confirms\nthat disclosures made in one type of context\u2014a state or\nlocal report, audit, or investigation\u2014may trigger the\npublic disclosure bar.

S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Ante, at 14\u2013\n18. But I do not share the Court\u2019s premise that if a \u201c \u2018legis\nlative purpose\u2019 \u201d were \u201c \u2018evident\u2019 \u201d from such history it\nwould make any difference.

S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted). Today, the\nCourt reads the phrase \u201cadministrative . . . report, hear\ning, audit, or investigation\u201d to encompass not only federal,\nbut also state and local, government sources. In my view,\nthe Court misreads the statutory text and gives insuffi\ncient weight to contextual and historical evidence of Con\ngress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a73730.

No\nparty here disputes that \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d refer\nonly to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.\n5\u20136. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word\n\u201cadministrative\u201d is more capacious, potentially reaching\nnot only federal, state, and local government sources but\nalso disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \u201cadministrative\u201d as\n\u201cpertain[ing] to administration, especially management,\n. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or\nthings\u201d).\n    Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress\u2019 choice of two\n\u201cclearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed\neral term\u201d as a \u201cvery strong contextual cue about the\nmeaning of \u2018administrative.\u2019 \u201d 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4\n2008). \u201c \u2018The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an\ninescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is\ncapable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 As\n       the Court observes, in enacting \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone\nously referred to the General Accounting Office\u2014now renamed the\nGovernment Accountability Office\u2014as the \u201cGovernment Accounting\nOffice.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 6.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 250, 255 (2000) (quoting Jarecki v. G. D.\nSearle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)). Here, the imme\ndiate proximity of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO]\u201d suggests\nthat \u201cadministrative\u201d should be read, like its neighbors, as\nreferring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had\nintended to include state or local government administra\ntive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer\nring generically to \u201cgovernmental\u201d sources. See 528 F. 3d,\nat 304\u2013305.\n   The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a\nsociis canon in concluding that \u201cadministrative\u201d does not\nrefer to private entities because of the meaning suggested\nby the slightly more distant neighbors \u201creport, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.\u201d See ante, at 5. I agree with the\nmajority that \u201cadministrative\u201d in this context does not\nreach private entities. But in my view, \u201ccongressional\u201d\nand \u201c[GAO]\u201d provide the better textual grounding for that\nconclusion. I see no reason why the \u201cadministrati[on]\u201d of a\nprivate university, for instance, could not issue a \u201creport,\u201d\norder an \u201caudit\u201d or \u201cinvestigation,\u201d or conduct a \u201chearing.\u201d\nNor, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, are private\nentities\u2014particularly those receiving federal funds or\nparticipating in federal programs\u2014incapable of making\n\u201cpublic disclosure[s]\u201d of fraud on the Federal Government.\n   Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court\nnevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of\nnoscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,\nconcluding that \u201c[a] list of three items, each quite distinct\nfrom the other no matter how construed, is too short to be\nparticularly illuminating.\u201d Ante, at 6\u20137. The three terms\nin Category 2, the Court concludes, are \u201ctoo few and too\ndisparate\u201d to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,\nat 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this\nway, and I would not do so here.\n   To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the\n\f4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v.

Recogniz\ning that the word \u201c \u2018[d]iscovery\u2019 \u201d is \u201cusable in many con\ntexts and with various shades of meaning,\u201d we observed\nthat it \u201cgathers meaning from the words around it\u201d and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all\ndescribe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and\nmining industries.\u201d Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of\nother contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,\nwe held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera\nequipment did not give rise to \u201cabnormal income\u201d even if\nsuch inventions might otherwise be understood as \u201cdis\ncover[ies].\u201d See id., at 307\u2013313. In my view, the three\nterms in Category 2 are no more \u201cdistinct\u201d or \u201cdisparate,\u201d\nante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly\ngiven the expansive plain meaning of \u201cdiscovery.\u201d Cf.\nante, at 7, n. 7.

There is\nno conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re\nspondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively\nfederal. See Brief for Respondent 23\u201324; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 25\u201326. Even reading Category 1\nmore broadly, however, does not change the exclusively\nfederal nature of \u201ccongressional\u201d and \u201c[GAO],\u201d which\nundermines whatever inference might be drawn from\ntaking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating\nthe entirety of \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of\nitems gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress\nmade in offsetting each category with commas and prepo\nsitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that\nmodify different nouns.\n   Finally, the Court also views \u201cnews media\u201d as \u201cdistinctly\nnonfederal in nature.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. But \u201cnews media\u201d\ndoes not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As\nthe Court of Appeals observed, although media sources\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings\u201d). Because Congress did not\nemploy a completely disjunctive list in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2014i.e., \u201ccongres\nsional or administrative or [GAO]\u201d\u2014the Reiter principle applies with\nless force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 73 (1984) (applying\ndisjunctive principle in construing statutory prohibition on assault and\nrobbery of any custodian of \u201c \u2018mail matter or of any money or other\nproperty of the United States,\u2019 \u201d and observing that \u201c[t]he three classes\nof property . . . are each separated by the conjunction \u2018or\u2019 \u201d (quoting 18\nU.

While the legislative record\nis concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise\ncaution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi\nble meaning\u2014i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also\nstate and local, government sources.\n    Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the\n1986 amendments, the \u201cGovernment knowledge\u201d bar\nunquestionably referred only to information in the posses\nsion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was\ncriticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an\ninitial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de\nscribed the FCA\u2019s history and need for legislative reform,\nnoting \u201cseveral restrictive court interpretations of the act\n. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 99\u2013345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For\ninstance, courts had applied the Government knowledge\nbar \u201ceven if the Government makes no effort to investigate\nor take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.\u201d\nId., at 12 (citing United States ex rel.

Rep., at 1\u20132;\naccord, H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013660, p. 18 (1986) (\u201cEvidence of\nfraud in Government programs and procurement is on a\nsteady rise\u201d). The Senate Report also articulated a desire\nto \u201cencourage any individual knowing of Government\nfraud to bring that information forward,\u201d and it identified\nas \u201cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective\nenforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the\npart of Federal enforcement agencies.\u201d S. Rep., at 2, 7.6\n  Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted\nlegislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfrom bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had\npreviously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even\nwhen the State\u2019s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,\nat 12\u201313. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was\ncontroversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the\n\u201coriginal source\u201d exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,\nWang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,\nat 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys\nGeneral criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).\n  6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator\n\nGrassley described the reform effort as stemming \u201cfrom a realization\nthat the Government needs help\u2014lots of help\u2014to adequately protect\ntaxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.\u201d\n132 Cong. Rec. 28580 (1986); see also United States ex rel. Siller v.\nBecton Dickinson & Co., 21 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (CA4 1994) (\u201cBy 1986,\nwhen section 3730(e)(4) was enacted, Congress had come to the conclu\nsion that fraud against the Government was apparently so rampant\nand difficult to identify that the Government could use all the help it\ncould get from private citizens with knowledge of fraud\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\f8     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v.

The amendments also\ncontained a number of provisions facilitating enforcement generally,\ne.g., lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that\n\u201cknowing\u201d violations require \u201cno proof of specific intent to defraud,\u201d 31\nU. S. C. \u00a73729(b)(1) (1988 ed.); lengthening the statute of limitations,\n\u00a73731(b); and authorizing treble damages, \u00a73729(a).\n    The Court fairly observes that the addition of \u201cnews media\u201d to the\njurisdictional bar undercuts attributing to Congress a \u201csingle-minded\u201d\nintent to expand the availability of qui tam relief. Ante, at 19. But\nneither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest\npossible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on \u201cnews media\u201d disclo\nsures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of\nexisting law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge\nbar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news\nmedia. In United States ex rel. Thompson v. Hays, 432 F. Supp. 253,\n256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence\n\u201cgleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread\npublic attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],\u201d when the\nDepartment of Justice \u201cfirst obtained information regarding the claims\n. . . as a result of [a] Washington Post article.\u201d Similarly, the court in\nUnited States v. Burmah Oil Co., 558 F. 2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) (per\ncuriam) characterized the Government knowledge bar as \u201cdis\ncourag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of\ntheir own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

See S. Rep., at 10\u201311 (describing\nhistory of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); ante,\nat 12\u201313. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amend\nments as striking a balance between the \u201ctwin goals of\nrejecting suits which the government is capable of pursu\ning itself, while promoting those which the government is\nnot equipped to bring on its own.\u201d United States ex rel.\nSpringfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 651\n(CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to\nbalance two competing goals supports moderation in\ninterpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather\nthan woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest\npossible extent.\n   Third, the legislative record \u201c \u2018contains no hint of any\nintention\u2019 \u201d to bar suits based on disclosures from state or\nlocal government sources. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 20 (quoting United States ex rel. Anti-\nDiscrimination Center of Metro N. Y., Inc. v. Westchester\nCty., 495 F. Supp. 2d 375, 383 (SDNY 2007)). Inclusion of\nstate or local government sources would have constituted\na significant departure from the Federal Government\nknowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.\nBut neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and\nHouse Committees nor statements by individual Members\nof Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation\nsuggest any consideration or debate about expanding the\npre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nindictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional\ninvestigations.\u201d Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that\nnews media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would\nnaturally\u2014perhaps as a result of the reporting\u2014come to the Govern\nment\u2019s attention, and thus would already have been covered under\nexisting law.\n\f10       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n              DIST. v.

WILSON\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsources.8\n   Although these points do not definitively resolve the\nquestion presented today, to my mind they counsel against\nreading \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) so broadly as to disturb\nthe balance Congress evidently sought to achieve through\nthe 1986 amendments. Today\u2019s decision risks such a\nresult. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by\nall appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the\npre-1986 regime. Construing \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) to encompass\nthe thousands of state and local government administra\ntive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the\nFederal Government knowledge of such sources, whether\nor not the Government is aware of the information or in a\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In  June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill\nthat would have barred qui tam actions based on information \u201cwhich\nthe Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior\nadministrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,\u201d \u201cdisclosed during the\ncourse of a congressional investigation,\u201d or \u201cdisseminated by any news\nmedia.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government\nitself (with a capital \u201cG\u201d) and to \u201ccongressional investigation[s]\u201d connote\nfederal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring\nactions \u201cbased upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of\na civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six\nmonths of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega\ntions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a\ncongressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or\nfrom the news media.\u201d S. Rep., at 43. The reference to suits in which\nthe Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term\n\u201cadministrative\u201d in the bill\u2019s reference to \u201ccongressional or [GAO]\u201d\nreports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or\nlocal government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several\nrespects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record\ncontains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government\nsources. See, e.g., 132 Cong. Rec. 20535\u201320537 (statement of Sen.\nGrassley); id., at 29321\u201329322 (statements of Reps. Glickman and\nBerman).\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

In response, Espinosa\n  asked the court to enforce the confirmation order by directing the\n  Department and United to cease any collection efforts. United op\n  posed the motion and filed a cross-motion under Federal Rule of Civil\n  Procedure 60(b)(4), seeking to set aside as void the confirmation or\n  der because the plan provision authorizing discharge of Espinosa\u2019s\n  student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code and the Bank\n  ruptcy Rules, and because United\u2019s due process rights were violated\n\f2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    when Espinosa failed to serve it with the required summons and\n    complaint.    Rejecting those arguments, the Bankruptcy Court\n    granted Espinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part and denied the cross\n    motion. The District Court reversed, holding that United was denied\n    due process when the confirmation order was issued without the re\n    quired service. The Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed. It concluded\n    that by confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue hard\n    ship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court at most\n    committed a legal error that United might have successfully ap\n    pealed, but that such error was no basis for setting aside the order as\n    void under Rule 60(b)(4). It also held that Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve\n    United was not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void be\n    cause United received actual notice of the plan and failed to object.\nHeld:\n    1. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is not void under\n Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) That order was a final judgment from which United did not\n appeal. Such finality ordinarily would \u201cstan[d] in the way of chal\n lenging [the order\u2019s] enforceability,\u201d Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bai\n ley, 557 U. S. ___, ___. However, Rule 60(b)(4) allows a party to seek\n relief from a final judgment that \u201cis void,\u201d but only in the rare in\n stance where a judgment is premised either on a certain type of ju\n risdictional error or on a violation of due process that deprives a\n party of notice or the opportunity to be heard. United\u2019s alleged error\n falls in neither category. Conceding that the Bankruptcy Court had\n jurisdiction to enter the confirmation order, United contends that the\n judgment is void because United did not receive adequate notice of\n Espinosa\u2019s proposed discharge. Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve the sum\n mons and complaint as required by the Bankruptcy Rules deprived\n United of a right granted by a procedural rule. United could have\n timely objected to this deprivation and appealed from an adverse rul\n ing on its objection. But this deprivation did not amount to a viola\n tion of due process, which requires notice \u201creasonably calculated, un\n der all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the\n pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present\n their objections,\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\n U. S. 306, 314. Here, United\u2019s actual notice of the filing and contents\n of Espinosa\u2019s plan more than satisfied its due process rights. Thus,\n Espinosa\u2019s failure to make the required service does not entitle\n United to relief under Rule 60(b)(4). Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Contrary to United\u2019s claim, the confirmation order is not void\n because the Bankruptcy Court lacked statutory authority to confirm\n Espinosa\u2019s plan absent an undue hardship finding under \u00a7523(a)(8).\n Such failure is not on par with the jurisdictional and notice failings\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that define void judgments qualifying for Rule 60(b)(4) relief. Section\n  523(a)(8) does not limit a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over student\n  loan debts or impose requirements that, if violated, would result in a\n  denial of due process. Instead, it requires a court to make a certain\n  findings before confirming a student loan debt\u2019s discharge. \u2018That this\n  requirement is \u201c \u2018self-executing,\u2019 \u201d Tennessee Student Assistance Cor\n  poration v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, 450, means only that the bankruptcy\n  court must make an undue hardship finding even if the creditor does\n  not request one; it does not mean that a bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to\n  make the finding renders its subsequent confirmation order void for\n  Rule 60(b)(4) purposes. Although the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s failure to\n  find undue hardship was a legal error, the confirmation order is en\n  forceable and binding on United because it had actual notice of the\n  error and failed to object or timely appeal. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     2. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must\n  confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without\n  an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless\n  the creditor timely raises a specific objection. A Chapter 13 plan pro\n  posing such a discharge without the required determination violates\n  \u00a7\u00a71328(a)(2) and 523(a)(8). Failure to comply with this self-executing\n  requirement should prevent confirmation even if the creditor fails to\n  object, or to appear in the proceeding at all, since a bankruptcy court\n  may confirm only a plan that, inter alia, complies with the \u201capplica\n  ble provisions\u201d of the Code. \u00a71325(a). Neither the Code nor the Rules\n  prevent parties from stipulating to the underlying facts of undue\n  hardship or prevent the creditor from waiving service of a summons\n  and complaint. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     3. Expanding the availability of Rule 60(b)(4) relief is not an ap\n  propriate prophylaxis for discouraging unscrupulous debtors from fil\n  ing Chapter 13 plans proposing to dispense with the undue hardship\n  requirement in hopes that the bankruptcy court will overlook the\n  proposal and the creditor will not object. Such bad-faith efforts\n  should be deterred by the specter of penalties that \u201c[d]ebtors and\n  their attorneys face . . . under various provisions for engaging in im\n  proper conduct in bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d Taylor v.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8), 1328. The\nFederal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to make this undue hardship determination\nin an adversary proceeding, see Rule 7001(6), which the\nparty seeking the determination must initiate by serving a\nsummons and complaint on his adversary, see Rules 7003,\n7004, 7008. The debtor in this case filed a plan with the\nBankruptcy Court that proposed to discharge a portion of\nhis student loan debt, but he failed to initiate the adver\u00ad\nsary proceeding as required for such discharge. The credi\u00ad\ntor received notice of, but did not object to, the plan, and\nfailed to file an appeal after the Bankruptcy Court subse\u00ad\nquently confirmed the plan. Years later, the creditor filed\na motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4)\nasking the Bankruptcy Court to rule that its order con\u00ad\nfirming the plan was void because the order was issued in\n\f2         UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation of the Code and Rules. We granted certiorari to\nresolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to\nwhether an order that confirms the discharge of a student\nloan debt in the absence of an undue hardship finding or\nan adversary proceeding, or both, is a void judgment for\nRule 60(b)(4) purposes.\n                              I\n  Between 1988 and 1989, respondent Francisco Espinosa\nobtained four federally guaranteed student loans for a\ntotal principal amount of $13,250. In 1992, Espinosa filed\na bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13. That Chapter\npermits individual debtors to develop a plan to repay all or\na portion of their debts over a period of time specified in\nthe plan. See Nobelman v. American Savings Bank, 508\nU. S. 324, 327 (1993); see also \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 1321; Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b). A proposed bankruptcy plan be\u00ad\ncomes effective upon confirmation, see \u00a7\u00a71324, 1325, and\nwill result in a discharge of the debts listed in the plan if\nthe debtor completes the payments the plan requires, see\n\u00a71328(a).\n  Espinosa\u2019s plan listed his student loan debt as his only\nspecific indebtedness. App. 15\u201318. The plan proposed to\nrepay only the principal on that debt, stating that the\nremainder\u2014the accrued interest\u2014would be discharged\nonce Espinosa repaid the principal. Id., at 26.\n  As the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require,\nthe clerk of the Bankruptcy Court mailed notice and a\ncopy of Espinosa\u2019s plan to petitioner United Student Aid\nFunds, Inc.

The plan also noted the deadlines for filing a\nproof of claim or an objection to the plan. Id., at 26\u201327.\n  United received this notice and, in response, filed a\nproof of claim for $17,832.15, an amount representing both\nthe principal and the accrued interest on Espinosa\u2019s stu\u00ad\ndent loans. Id., at 35. United did not object to the plan\u2019s\nproposed discharge of Espinosa\u2019s student loan interest\nwithout a determination of undue hardship, nor did it\nobject to Espinosa\u2019s failure to initiate an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding to determine the dischargeability of that debt.\n  In May 1993, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed\nEspinosa\u2019s plan without holding an adversary proceeding\nor making a finding of undue hardship. One month later,\nthe Chapter 13 trustee mailed United a form notice stat\u00ad\ning that \u201c[t]he amount of the claim filed differs from the\namount listed for payment in the plan\u201d and that \u201c[y]our\nclaim will be paid as listed in the plan.\u201d Id., at 44. The\nform also apprised United that if United \u201cwishe[d] to\ndispute the above stated treatment of the claim,\u201d it had\nthe \u201cresponsibility\u201d to notify the trustee within 30 days.\nIbid. United did not respond to that notice.\n  In May 1997, Espinosa completed the payments on his\nstudent loan principal, as required by the plan. Shortly\nthereafter, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Espinosa\u2019s\nstudent loan interest.2\n  In 2000, the United States Department of Education\ncommenced efforts to collect the unpaid interest on Espi\u00ad\nnosa\u2019s student loans.3 In response, Espinosa filed a mo\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The discharge order contained an apparent clerical error that the\n\ncourts below considered and addressed in adjudicating these proceed\u00ad\nings. See n. 4, infra.\n  3 After Espinosa completed payments under the plan, United as\u00ad\n\nsigned Espinosa\u2019s loans to the Department under a reinsurance agree\u00ad\nment. After these proceedings began, United requested and received a\n\f4       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in 2003 asking the Bankruptcy Court to enforce its\n1997 discharge order by directing the Department and\nUnited to cease all efforts to collect the unpaid interest on\nhis student loan debt.\n   United opposed that motion and filed a cross-motion\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) seeking to\nset aside as void the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s 1993 order con\u00ad\nfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan. United made two arguments in\nsupport of its motion. First, United claimed that the\nprovision of Espinosa\u2019s plan authorizing the discharge of\nhis student loan interest was inconsistent with the Code,\nwhich requires a court to find undue hardship before\ndischarging a student loan debt, \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(8), 1328(a), and\nwith the Bankruptcy Rules, which require the court to\nmake the undue hardship finding in an adversary proceed\u00ad\ning, see Rule 7001(6). Second, United argued that its due\nprocess rights had been violated because Espinosa failed\nto serve it with the summons and complaint the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Rules require as a prerequisite to an adversarial\nproceeding. See Rules 7003, 7004, 7008.\n   The Bankruptcy Court rejected both arguments, granted\nEspinosa\u2019s motion in relevant part, denied United\u2019s cross\u00ad\nmotion, and ordered all claimants to cease and desist their\ncollection efforts. United sought review in the District\nCourt, which reversed. That court held that United was\ndenied due process because the confirmation order was\nissued without service of the summons and complaint the\nBankruptcy Rules require.\n   Espinosa appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, which issued an initial per curiam opinion re\u00ad\nmanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider\ncorrecting an apparent clerical error in its discharge or\u00ad\nder.4 530 F. 3d 895, 899 (2008). The Bankruptcy Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrecall of the loans from the Department. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63.\n  4 The one-page discharge order contained a paragraph that purported\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrected the error, after which the Court of Appeals\nresubmitted the case and reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan without first finding undue\nhardship in an adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy\nCourt at most committed a legal error that United might\nhave successfully appealed, but that any such legal error\nwas not a basis for setting aside the confirmation order as\nvoid under Rule 60(b). 553 F. 3d 1193, 1198\u20131202 (2008).5\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals held that although\nEspinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons and\ncomplaint before seeking a discharge of his student loan\ndebt violated the Bankruptcy Rules, this defect in service\nwas not a basis upon which to declare the judgment void\nbecause United received actual notice of Espinosa\u2019s plan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nto exclude \u201c \u2018any debt . . . for a student loan\u2019 \u201d from the discharge. 530 \n\nF. 3d 895, 896 (CA9 2008). That provision appeared irreconcilable with\nthe confirmation order, which contemplated the discharge of the inter\u00ad\nest on Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt. Suggesting that the Bankruptcy\nCourt may have automatically generated the discharge order without\ntailoring it to the terms of the confirmation order, the Court of Appeals\nremanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court to consider amending the\ndischarge order to conform to the confirmation order. Id., at 899; see\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a) (authorizing a court to \u201ccorrect a clerical\nmistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission\u201d). On remand,\nthe Bankruptcy Court found that the text of its discharge order except\u00ad\ning Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt from discharge \u201cwas inserted because\nof a clerical mistake\u201d and struck that language from the order. App. 48.\n   Although certain amici press the point, United has not challenged\nthe substance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s amendment to the order or\nasked us to consider whether such amendment was proper under Rule\n60(a). See Brief for Petitioner 42; Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. Thus,\nwe express no view on those issues. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial\nServices, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 97, n. 4 (1991) (noting that \u201cwe do not\nordinarily address issues raised only by amici\u201d).\n   5 In so doing, the Court of Appeals disagreed with two other Courts of\n\nAppeals. See In re Mersmann, 505 F. 3d 1033, 1047\u20131049 (CA10 2007)\n(en banc); Whelton v.

Although the term \u201cvoid\u201d describes a result, rather\nthan the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable,\nit suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by\na fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised\neven after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally id., \u00a712.\nThe list of such infirmities is exceedingly short; otherwise,\nRule 60(b)(4)\u2019s exception to finality would swallow the\nrule.\n   \u201cA judgment is not void,\u201d for example, \u201csimply because it\nis or may have been erroneous.\u201d Hoult v.

Similarly, a motion under Rule 60(b)(4)\nis not a substitute for a timely appeal. Kocher v. Dow\nChemical Co., 132 F. 3d 1225, 1229 (CA8 1997); see\nMoore\u2019s \u00a760.44[1][a], at 60\u2013150. Instead, Rule 60(b)(4)\napplies only in the rare instance where a judgment is\npremised either on a certain type of jurisdictional error or\non a violation of due process that deprives a party of notice\nor the opportunity to be heard. See United States v. Boch\nOldsmobile, Inc., 909 F. 2d 657, 661 (CA1 1990); Moore\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfraud.\u201d Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Rule 60(b)(4)\nmotion should be treated as a \u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d a plan subject to\n\u00a71330\u2019s time limit and substantive limitation to motions based on\nfraud. Compare Whelton, 432 F. 3d, at 156, n. 2, with In re Fesq, 153\nF. 3d 113, 119, and n. 8 (CA3 1998). We need not settle that question,\nhowever, because the parties did not raise it in the courts below. And\neven under a theory that would treat United\u2019s Rule 60(b)(4) motion as a\n\u201ccomplaint to revoke\u201d the plan, United\u2019s failure to file its motion within\n\u00a71330(a)\u2019s 180-day deadline and its failure to seek relief on the basis of\nfraud did not deprive those courts\u2014and does not deprive us\u2014of author\u00ad\nity to consider the motion on the merits because those limitations are\nnot jurisdictional.

Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 5, 11. Such an argument would fail in any\nevent. First, \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s statutory requirement that a\nbankruptcy court find undue hardship before discharging\na student loan debt is a precondition to obtaining a dis\u00ad\ncharge order, not a limitation on the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 515\u2013516 (2006). Second, the requirement that a\nbankruptcy court make this finding in an adversary pro\u00ad\nceeding derives from the Bankruptcy Rules, see Rule Proc.\n7001(6), which are \u201cprocedural rules adopted by the Court\nfor the orderly transaction of its business\u201d that are \u201cnot\njurisdictional.\u201d Kontrick v.

Specifically, United argues that the\nBankruptcy Court violated United\u2019s due process rights by\nconfirming Espinosa\u2019s plan despite Espinosa\u2019s failure to\nserve the summons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules\nrequire for the commencement of an adversary proceeding.\nWe disagree.\n     Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve United with a summons\nand complaint deprived United of a right granted by a\nprocedural rule. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7004(b)(3).\nUnited could have timely objected to this deprivation and\nappealed from an adverse ruling on its objection. But this\ndeprivation did not amount to a violation of United\u2019s\nconstitutional right to due process. Due process requires\nnotice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,\nto apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action\nand afford them an opportunity to present their objec\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Mullane v.

Here, United received actual notice of the\nfiling and contents of Espinosa\u2019s plan. This more than\nsatisfied United\u2019s due process rights. Accordingly, on\nthese facts, Espinosa\u2019s failure to serve a summons and\ncomplaint does not entitle United to relief under Rule\n60(b)(4).\n                            B\n     Unable to demonstrate a jurisdictional error or a due\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Specifically, they contend\nthat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order is void\nbecause the court lacked statutory authority to confirm\nEspinosa\u2019s plan absent a finding of undue hardship. In\nsupport of this contention, they cite the text of \u00a7523(a)(8),\nwhich provides that student loan debts guaranteed by\ngovernmental units are not dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a court\nfinds undue hardship. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(8) (emphasis\nadded). They argue that this language imposes a \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting\u2019 limitation on the effect of a discharge order\u201d\nthat renders the order legally unenforceable, and thus\nvoid, if it is not satisfied.

In addition, United cites \u00a71325(a)(1), which\ninstructs bankruptcy courts to confirm only those plans\nthat comply with \u201cthe . . . applicable provisions\u201d of the\nCode. Reading these provisions in tandem, United argues\nthat an order confirming a plan that purports to discharge\na student loan debt without an undue hardship finding is\n\u201cdoubly beyond the court\u2019s authority and therefore void.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 13.\n   We are not persuaded that a failure to find undue hard\u00ad\nship in accordance with \u00a7523(a)(8) is on par with the\njurisdictional and notice failings that define void judg\u00ad\nments that qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(4). As\nnoted, \u00a7523(a)(8) does not limit the bankruptcy court\u2019s\njurisdiction over student loan debts.10 Supra, at 9\u201310; see\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Sections 1328(a) and 523(a)(8) provide that student loan debt is\n\ndischargeable in a Chapter 13 proceeding if a court makes a finding of\nundue hardship. In contrast, other provisions in Chapter 13 provide\nthat certain other debts are not dischargeable under any circumstances.\nSee, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(1)(B), (C) (specified tax debts); \u00a7523(a)(5) (domestic\nsupport obligations); \u00a7523(a)(9) (debts \u201ccaused by\u201d the debtor\u2019s unlawful\n\f12       UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

Nor\ndoes the provision impose requirements that, if violated,\nwould result in a denial of due process. Instead, \u00a7523(a)(8)\nrequires a court to make a certain finding before confirm\u00ad\ning the discharge of a student loan debt. It is true, as we\nexplained in Hood, that this requirement is \u201c \u2018self\u00ad\nexecuting.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 450.11 But that means only that the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\noperation of a vehicle while intoxicated). We express no view on the\nconditions under which an order confirming the discharge of one of\nthese types of debt could be set aside as void.\n    11 The Government suggests that \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s \u201cself-executing\u201d nature\n\nderives in part from the text of \u00a7523(a), which states that \u201c[a] discharge\nunder section 727 . . . or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an\nindividual debtor from any debt,\u201d including the student loan debts\nspecified in paragraph (8) (emphasis added); see Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 18; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 1\u20132. That is\nnot what we concluded in Hood and, in this case, would be irrelevant in\nany event.\n    In Hood, we described as \u201c \u2018self-executing\u2019 \u201d paragraph (8)\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntion that student loan debt not be discharged \u201cunless\u201d an undue hard\u00ad\nship determination is made. 541 U. S., at 450. The \u201cdoes not dis\u00ad\ncharge\u201d language in \u00a7523(a), which applies generally to every\nenumerated paragraph in that section\u2014and to which we never referred\nin Hood\u2014was not relevant to our analysis. That is evident from the\nauthority we cited to support our description of \u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s condition as\n\u201c \u2018self-executing.\u2019 \u201d E.g., id., at 450 (citing S. Rep. No. 95\u2013989, p. 79\n(1978), which states that \u201c[p]aragraph (8) . . . is intended to be self\u00ad\nexecuting\u201d insofar as \u201cthe lender or institution is not required to file a\ncomplaint to determine the nondischargeability of any student loan\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n    In any event, the \u201cdoes not discharge\u201d language in \u00a7523(a) is inappli\u00ad\ncable to this case.

See Part III, infra. But\nthe order remains enforceable and binding on United\nbecause United had notice of the error and failed to object\nor timely appeal.\n   United\u2019s response\u2014that it had no obligation to object to\nEspinosa\u2019s plan until Espinosa served it with the sum\u00ad\nmons and complaint the Bankruptcy Rules require, Brief\nfor Petitioner 33\u2014is unavailing. Rule 60(b)(4) does not\nprovide a license for litigants to sleep on their rights.\nUnited had actual notice of the filing of Espinosa\u2019s plan,\nits contents, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s subsequent\nconfirmation of the plan. In addition, United filed a proof\nof claim regarding Espinosa\u2019s student loan debt, thereby\nsubmitting itself to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction\nwith respect to that claim. See Langenkamp v. Culp, 498\nU. S. 42, 44 (1990) (per curiam). United therefore forfeited\nits arguments regarding the validity of service or the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsis added). Section 1328(a) thus incorporates by reference paragraph\n(8) of \u00a7523(a), including that paragraph\u2019s self-executing requirement for\nan undue hardship determination, but does not incorporate the \u201cdoes\nnot discharge\u201d text of \u00a7523(a) itself.\n  12 United relies on our decisions in United States ex rel. Wilson v.\n\nWalker, 109 U. S. 258 (1883), and Vallely v. Northern Fire & Marine\nIns. Co., 254 U. S. 348 (1920), to argue otherwise. Those authorities\nare not controlling because they predate Rule 60(b)(4)\u2019s enactment and\nbecause we interpreted the statutes at issue in those cases as stripping\ncourts of jurisdiction\u2014either over the parties, id., at 354\u2013356, or the\nres, Wilson, supra, at 265\u2013266\u2014and United concedes that the statutory\nlimit in this case is not jurisdictional. See supra, at 9.\n\f14     UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v. ESPINOSA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadequacy of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s procedures by failing\nto raise a timely objection in that court.\n   Rule 60(b)(4) strikes a balance between the need for\nfinality of judgments and the importance of ensuring that\nlitigants have a full and fair opportunity to litigate a\ndispute. Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan\u2019s\ncontents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan\nbefore the time for appeal expires, that party has been\nafforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the\nparty\u2019s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not\njustify Rule 60(b)(4) relief. We thus agree with the Court\nof Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s confirmation order\nis not void.\n                            III\n  In issuing its judgment, however, the Court of Appeals\nlooked beyond the narrow question whether the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order confirming Espinosa\u2019s plan was void\nunder Rule 60(b)(4). It canvassed other bankruptcy court\ndecisions within the Circuit that presented a different\nquestion\u2014whether a bankruptcy court presented with a\ndebtor\u2019s plan that proposes to discharge a student loan\ndebt, in the absence of an adversary proceeding to deter\u00ad\nmine undue hardship, should confirm the plan despite its\nfailure to comply with the Code and Rules. The Court of\nAppeals noted that some Bankruptcy Courts had declined\nto confirm such plans \u201ceven when the creditor fail[ed] to\nobject to the plan.\u201d 553 F. 3d, at 1205. The court disap\u00ad\nproved that practice and overruled those cases, stating\nthat bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the\ndischarge of a student loan debt without a determination\nof undue hardship in an adversary proceeding unless the\ncreditor timely raises a specific objection. Ibid. This, we\nthink, was a step too far.\n  As Espinosa concedes, Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 36, a Chapter\n13 plan that proposes to discharge a student loan debt\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Failure to comply with this\nself-executing requirement should prevent confirmation of\nthe plan even if the creditor fails to object, or to appear in\nthe proceeding at all. See Hood, 541 U. S., at 450.13 That\nis because \u00a71325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to con\u00ad\nfirm a plan only if the court finds, inter alia, that the plan\ncomplies with the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the Code.\n\u00a71325(a) (providing that a bankruptcy court \u201cshall confirm\na plan\u201d if the plan \u201ccomplies with the provisions of\u201d Chap\u00ad\nter 13 and with \u201cother applicable provisions of this title\u201d);\nsee Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.

Section 523(a)(8) renders student loan debt presumptively\nnondischargeable \u201cunless\u201d a determination of undue hardship is made.\nIn contrast, the debts listed in \u00a7523(c), which include certain debts\nobtained by fraud or \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor,\u201d\n\u00a7523(a)(6), are presumptively dischargeable \u201cunless\u201d the creditor\nrequests a hearing to determine the debt\u2019s dischargeability. The Court\nof Appeals\u2019 approach would subject student loan debt to the same rules\nas the debts specified in \u00a7523(c), notwithstanding the evident differ\u00ad\nences in the statutory framework for discharging the two types of debt.\n   14 In other contexts, we have held that courts have the discretion, but\n\nnot the obligation, to raise on their own initiative certain nonjurisdic\u00ad\ntional barriers to suit. See Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202, 209\n(2006) (statute of limitations); Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 134\n(1987) (habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s exhaustion of state remedies).\nSection 1325(a) does more than codify this principle; it requires bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to address and correct a defect in a debtor\u2019s proposed plan\neven if no creditor raises the issue.\n\f16      UNITED STUDENT AID FUNDS, INC. v.

We thus assume\nthat, in some cases, a debtor and creditor may agree that\npayment of a student loan debt will cause the debtor an\nundue hardship sufficient to justify discharge. In such a\ncase, there is no reason that compliance with the undue\nhardship requirement should impose significant costs on\nthe parties or materially delay confirmation of the plan.\nNeither the Code nor the Rules prevent the parties from\nstipulating to the underlying facts of undue hardship, and\nneither prevents the creditor from waiving service of a\nsummons and complaint. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc.\n7004; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k). But, to comply with\n\u00a7523(a)(8)\u2019s directive, the bankruptcy court must make an\nindependent determination of undue hardship before a\nplan is confirmed, even if the creditor fails to object or\nappear in the adversary proceeding. See supra, at 12.\n                            IV\n  United argues that our failure to declare the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s order void will encourage unscrupulous\ndebtors to abuse the Chapter 13 process by filing plans\nproposing to dispense with the undue hardship require\u00ad\nment in the hopes the bankruptcy court will overlook the\nproposal and the creditor will not object. In the event the\nobjectionable provision is discovered, United claims, the\ndebtor can withdraw the plan and file another without\npenalty.\n  We acknowledge the potential for bad-faith litigation\ntactics.

Argued December 1, 2009\u2014Decided March 8, 2010*\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n  2005 (BAPCPA) amended the Bankruptcy Code to define a class of\n  bankruptcy professionals termed \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies].\u201d 11 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7101(12A). That class includes, with limited exceptions, \u201cany person\n  who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person . . . for\n  . . . payment . . . , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.\u201d Ibid.\n  The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from \u201cadvis[ing] an as\n  sisted person . . . to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for\n  bankruptcy] . . . .\u201d \u00a7526(a)(4). It also requires them to disclose in\n  their advertisements for certain services that the services are with\n  respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and\n  to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).\n      The plaintiffs in this litigation\u2014a law firm and others (collectively\n  Milavetz)\u2014filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, ar\n  guing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA\u2019s debt-relief-agency\n  provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional\n  debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertise\n  ments. The District Court found that \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d does not\n  include attorneys and that \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528 are unconstitutional as ap\n  plied to that class of professionals. The Eighth Circuit affirmed in\n  part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court\u2019s conclusion\n  that attorneys are not \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d; upholding application\n  of \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding \u00a7526(a)(4)\n  unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 08\u20131225, United States v.

UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    from advising assisted persons to incur any additional debt in con\n    templation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent\n    prebankruptcy planning.\nHeld:\n    1. Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons\n are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA. By definition, \u201cbank\n ruptcy assistance\u201d includes several services commonly performed by\n attorneys, e.g., providing \u201cadvice, counsel, [or] document prepara\n tion,\u201d \u00a7101(4A). Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the\n debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude\n attorneys. See \u00a7\u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2013(E). Milavetz relies on the fact that\n \u00a7101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a nar\n rower understanding. On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition\n preparer would qualify\u2014an implausibility given that a \u201cdebt relief\n agency\u201d is \u201cany person who provides any bankruptcy assistance . . . or\n who is a bankruptcy petition preparer,\u201d ibid. Milavetz\u2019s other argu\n ments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    2. Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advis\n ing a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bank\n ruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose. The statute\u2019s language, to\n gether with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of \u00a7526(a)(4) the\n natural one. Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v. Pender, 289 U. S. 472, sup\n ports this conclusion. The Court in that case read now-repealed\n \u00a796(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees\n payment \u201cin contemplation of the filing of a petition,\u201d to require that\n the portended bankruptcy have \u201cinduce[d]\u201d the transfer at issue, id.,\n at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.\n The Court identified the \u201ccontrolling question\u201d as \u201cwhether the\n thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction,\u201d\n ibid.    Given the substantial similarities between \u00a7\u00a796(d) and\n 526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise\n whether the impelling reason for \u201cadvis[ing] an assisted person . . . to\n incur more debt\u201d was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. In prac\n tice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of\n advice to \u201cload up\u201d on debt with the expectation of obtaining its dis\n charge.     The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct. The\n Court rejects Milavetz\u2019s arguments for a more expansive view of\n \u00a7526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is\n impermissibly vague. Pp. 9\u201318.\n    3. Section 528\u2019s disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Mi\n lavetz. Consistent with Milavetz\u2019s characterization, the Court pre\n sumes that this is an as-applied challenge. Because \u00a7528 is directed\n at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure re\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  quirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less\n  exacting scrutiny set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel\n  of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs. There, the Court\n  found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\n  quirements offend the First Amendment, \u201can advertiser\u2019s rights are\n  adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasona\n  bly related to the State\u2019s interest in preventing deception of consum\n  ers.\u201d Id., at 651. Section 528\u2019s requirements share the essential fea\n  tures of the rule challenged in Zauderer. The disclosures are\n  intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial\n  advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the\n  advertiser\u2019s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.\n  Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying\n  any additional information through their advertisements. In re R. M.\n  J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished. Because \u00a7528\u2019s requirements are\n  \u201creasonably related\u201d to the Government\u2019s interest in preventing con\n  sumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Mi\n  lavetz.

See 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7101(3), (12A). These consolidated cases present the\nthreshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agen\ncies when they provide qualifying services. Because we\nagree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must\nalso consider whether the Act\u2019s provisions governing debt\nrelief agencies\u2019 advice to clients, \u00a7526(a)(4), and requiring\nthem to make certain disclosures in their advertisements,\n\f2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n\u00a7\u00a7528(a) and (b)(2), violate the First Amendment rights of\nattorneys. Concluding that the Court of Appeals con\nstrued \u00a7526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment\nthat the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like\nthe Court of Appeals, we uphold \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure re\nquirements as applied in these consolidated cases.\n                              I\n   In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Con\ngress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provi\nsions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.\nSome of these measures apply to the broad class of bank\nruptcy professionals termed \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies].\u201d That\ncategory includes, with limited exceptions, \u201cany person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson in return for . . . payment . . . , or who is a bank\nruptcy petition preparer.\u201d \u00a7101(12A).1 \u201cBankruptcy assis\ntance\u201d refers to goods or services \u201cprovided to an assisted\nperson with the express or implied purpose of providing\ninformation, advice, counsel, document preparation, or\nfiling, or attendance at a creditors\u2019 meeting or appearing\nin a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing\nlegal representation with respect to a case or proceeding\u201d\nin bankruptcy. \u00a7101(4A). An \u201cassisted person\u201d is someone\nwith limited nonexempt property whose debts consist\nprimarily of consumer debts. \u00a7101(3). The BAPCPA\nsubjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions\nand requirements, as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and 528. As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Congress excluded from the definition of \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d any\n\n\u201cofficer, director, employee, or agent of a person who provides [bank\nruptcy] assistance\u201d; any \u201cnonprofit organization that is exempt from\ntaxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\u201d;\n\u201ca creditor of [an] assisted person\u201d who is helping that person \u201cto\nrestructure any debt owed . . . to the creditor\u201d; \u201ca depository institu\ntion\u201d; or \u201can author, publisher, distributor, or seller of works subject to\ncopyright protection under title 17, when acting in such capacity.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2013(E).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, \u00a7526(a) establishes several rules of profes\nsional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agen\ncies. Among them, \u00a7526(a)(4) states that a debt relief\nagency shall not \u201cadvise an assisted person . . . to incur\nmore debt in contemplation of such person filing a case\nunder this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy peti\ntion preparer fee or charge for services performed as part\nof preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under\nthis title.\u201d\n   Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include\ncertain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection (a)\nprovides that debt relief agencies must \u201cclearly and con\nspicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy\nassistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy di\nrected to the general public . . . that the services or bene\nfits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.\u201d\n\u00a7528(a)(3). It also requires them to include the following,\n\u201cor a substantially similar statement\u201d: \u201cWe are a debt\nrelief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief\nunder the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d \u00a7528(a)(4). Subsection (b)\nrequires essentially the same disclosures in advertise\nments \u201cindicating that the debt relief agency provides\nassistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage fore\nclosures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collec\ntion pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.\u201d\n\u00a7528(b)(2). Debt relief agencies advertising such services\nmust disclose \u201cthat the assistance may involve bankruptcy\nrelief,\u201d \u00a7528(b)(2)(A), and must identify themselves as\n\u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d as required by \u00a7528(a)(4), see\n\u00a7528(b)(2)(B).\n                              II\n  The plaintiffs in this litigation\u2014the law firm Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz, P. A.; the firm\u2019s president, Robert J.\nMilavetz; a bankruptcy attorney at the firm, Barbara\nNilva Nevin; and two of the firm\u2019s clients (collectively\n\f4      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nMilavetz)\u2014filed a preenforcement suit in Federal District\nCourt seeking declaratory relief with respect to the Act\u2019s\ndebt-relief-agency provisions. Milavetz asked the court to\nhold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may\nfreely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not\nidentify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.\n   Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not \u201cdebt relief\nagenc[ies]\u201d as that term is used in the BAPCPA. In the\nalternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that \u00a7\u00a7526(a)(4)\nand 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to\nattorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that\nthe term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d does not include attorneys,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08\u20131119, p. A\u201315, but only\nafter finding that \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528\u2014provisions expressly\napplicable only to debt relief agencies\u2014are unconstitu\ntional as applied to this class of professionals.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. 541 F. 3d 785 (2008). Relying\non the Act\u2019s plain language, the court unanimously re\njected the District Court\u2019s conclusion that attorneys are\nnot \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d within the meaning of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District\nCourt concerning the constitutionality of \u00a7528. Conclud\ning that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer\ndeception and are \u201creasonably related\u201d to that interest, the\ncourt upheld the application of \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure require\nments to attorneys. Id., at 796\u2013797 (citing Zauderer v.\nOffice of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,\n471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985)).\n   A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed\nwith the District Court that \u00a7526(a)(4) is invalid. Deter\nmining that \u00a7526(a)(4) \u201cbroadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy,\u201d even when that advice constitutes prudent\nprebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bank\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nruptcy laws, 541 F. 3d, at 793, the majority held that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermedi\nate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice\nto abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construc\ntion would avoid most constitutional difficulties. See id.,\nat 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,2 we\ngranted certiorari to resolve the question of \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s\nscope. 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We also agreed to consider\nthe threshold question whether attorneys who provide\nbankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are \u201cdebt relief\nagenc[ies]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7101(12A) and the re\nlated question whether \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements are\nconstitutional.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  We first consider whether the term \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d\nincludes attorneys. If it does not, we need not reach the\nother questions presented, as \u00a7\u00a7526 and 528 govern only\nthe conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz chal\nlenges the validity of those provisions based on their\napplication to attorneys. The Government contends that\n\u201cdebt relief agency\u201d plainly includes attorneys, while\nMilavetz urges that it does not. We conclude that the\nGovernment has the better view.\n  As already noted, a debt relief agency is \u201cany person\nwho provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted\nperson\u201d in return for payment. \u00a7101(12A). By definition,\n\u201cbankruptcy assistance\u201d includes several services com\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare 541 F. 3d 785, 794 (CA8 2008) (case below), with Hersh v.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Mukasey, 553 F. 3d 743, 761, 764 (CA5 2008)\n(holding that \u00a7526(a)(4) can be narrowly construed to prohibit only\nadvice to abuse or manipulate the bankruptcy system and that, so\nconstrued, it is constitutional).\n\f6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nmonly performed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of\nbankruptcy assistance, including the \u201cprovi[sion of] legal\nrepresentation with respect to a case or proceeding,\u201d\n\u00a7101(4A), may be provided only by attorneys.             See\n\u00a7110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from\nproviding legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating specific\nexceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress\ngave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.\nSee \u00a7\u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2013(E). Thus, as the Government con\ntends, the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys\nare debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying\nservices to assisted persons.3\n  In advocating a narrower understanding of that term,\nMilavetz relies heavily on the fact that \u00a7101(12A) does not\nexpressly include attorneys. That omission stands in\ncontrast, it argues, to the provision\u2019s explicit inclusion of\n\u201cbankruptcy petition preparer[s]\u201d\u2014a category of profes\nsionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see\n\u00a7110(a)(1). But Milavetz does not contend, nor could it\ncredibly, that only professionals expressly included in the\ndefinition are debt relief agencies. On that reading, no\nprofessional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer\nwould qualify\u2014an implausible reading given that the\nstatute defines \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d as \u201cany person who\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Although reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of\n\nthe statute\u2019s unambiguous language, we note the support that record\nprovides for the Government\u2019s reading. Statements in a Report of the\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Act\u2019s purpose indicate\nconcern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys as well as\nother bankruptcy professionals. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109\u201331, pt. 1,\np. 5 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the legislative record else\nwhere documents misconduct by attorneys. See, e.g., Hearing on H. R.\n3150 before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law\nof the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. III,\np. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998 Hearings). (While the 1998 Hearings\npreceded the BAPCPA\u2019s enactment by several years, they form part of\nthe record cited by the 2005 House Report. See H. R. Rep., at 7.)\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

The provision\u2019s silence regarding at\ntorneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf. Heintz v. Jenkins,\n514 U. S. 291, 294 (1995) (holding that \u201cdebt collector\u201d as\nused in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the defini\ntion\u2019s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).\n    Milavetz\u2019s other arguments for excluding attorneys\nsimilarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute\u2019s\nplain language.       Milavetz contends that 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7526(d)(2)\u2019s instruction that \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and 528 should\nnot \u201cbe deemed to limit or curtail\u201d States\u2019 authority to\n\u201cdetermine and enforce qualifications for the practice of\nlaw\u201d counsels against reading \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d to in\nclude attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States\u2019\nrole in regulating the legal profession is to make the\nBAPCPA\u2019s professional conduct rules inapplicable to\nlawyers. We find that \u00a7526(d)(2) supports the opposite\nconclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact\nthat provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not\napply to attorneys. Milavetz\u2019s broader claim that reading\n\u00a7101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on\nan area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.\nCongress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen\naspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial\nfederal concern. See, e.g., Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v.\nPender, 289 U. S. 472, 477\u2013479 (1933) (finding broad\nauthorization in former \u00a796(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978)\nfor courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor\u2019s\nprepetition attorney\u2019s fees).\n    Milavetz next argues that \u00a7101(12A)\u2019s exception for any\n\u201cofficer, director, employee, or agent of a person who pro\nvides\u201d bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to\ninclude \u201cpartners.\u201d \u00a7101(12A)(A). In light of that omis\nsion, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies\n\f8       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwill obligate entire law firms to comply with \u00a7\u00a7526, 527,\nand 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while\nthe agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typi\ncally organized as partnerships are shielded from those\nrequirements. Given that the partnership structure is not\nunique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclu\nsion would be revealing of Congress\u2019 intent only with\nrespect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are them\nselves \u201cperson[s]\u201d under the BAPCPA, see \u00a7101(41), and\ncan qualify as \u201cdebt relief agenc[ies]\u201d when they meet the\ncriteria set forth in \u00a7101(12A). Moreover, a partnership\u2019s\nemployees and agents are exempted from \u00a7101(12A) in the\nsame way as the employees and agents of other organiza\ntions. To the extent that partners may be subject to the\ndebt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is\nconsistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow\nfrom the partnership structure, cf. Strang v. Bradner, 114\nU. S. 555, 561 (1885). Accordingly, we decline to attribute\nthe significance Milavetz suggests to \u00a7101(12A)(A)\u2019s fail\nure to include partners among the exempted actors.4\n   All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of consti\ntutional avoidance requires us to read \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Reviving an argument that Milavetz abandoned, amici contend that\n\n\u00a7527(b) undermines the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7101(12A) because it\nrequires a debt relief agency to inform an assisted person of his right to\nhire an attorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to\nprovide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34. This argument fails\non its own terms. Even if \u00a7101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz\ncontends, \u00a7527(b) would still produce the result of which its amici\ncomplain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform\nassisted persons that they \u201c \u2018can get help in some localities from a\nbankruptcy petition preparer,\u2019 \u201d and there is no question that bank\nruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to\nthat requirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief\nagencies\u2014whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers\u2014to\ninform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy\nassistance services.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The avoidance canon,\nhowever, \u201cis a tool for choosing between competing plausi\nble interpretations of a statutory text.\u201d Clark v. Martinez,\n543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005). In applying that tool, we will\nconsider only those constructions of a statute that are\n\u201c \u2018fairly possible.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Security Industrial\nBank, 459 U. S. 70, 78 (1982). For the reasons already\ndiscussed, the text and statutory context of \u00a7101(12A)\nforeclose a reading of \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d that excludes\nattorneys. Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who pro\nvide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt\nrelief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.\n                              B\n   Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies\nwhen they provide qualifying services, we next address the\nscope and validity of \u00a7526(a)(4). Characterizing the stat\nute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client\ncommunications that is not adequately tailored to con\nstrain only speech the Government has a substantial\ninterest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule\nsubstantially overbroad. 541 F. 3d, at 793\u2013794, and n. 10.\nFor the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.\n   Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from\n\u201cadvis[ing] an assisted person\u201d either \u201cto incur more debt\nin contemplation of\u201d filing for bankruptcy \u201cor to pay an\nattorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for\nservices\u201d performed in preparation for filing. Only the\nfirst of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the\ncorrectness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the parties\nfirst dispute the provision\u2019s scope. The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that \u201c\u00a7526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief\nagency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any\nadditional debt when the assisted person is contemplating\nbankruptcy.\u201d Id., at 793. Under that reading, an attorney\n\f10     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nis prohibited from providing all manner of \u201cbeneficial\nadvice\u2014even if the advice could help the assisted person\navoid filing for bankruptcy altogether.\u201d Ibid.\n   Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, Milavetz contends\nthat \u00a7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from advising\na client to incur any new debt while considering whether\nto file for bankruptcy. Construing the provision more\nbroadly still, Milavetz contends that \u00a7526(a)(4) forbids not\nonly affirmative advice but also any discussion of the\nadvantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more\ndebt. Like the panel majority\u2019s, Milavetz\u2019s reading rests\nprimarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the\nphrase \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy encompasses any\nadvice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might\nsoon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate\nthe need to file. Milavetz also maintains that if \u00a7526(a)(4)\nwere construed more narrowly, as urged by the Govern\nment and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to\ninevitably chill some protected speech.\n   The Government continues to advocate a narrower\nconstruction of the statute, urging that Milavetz\u2019s reading\nis untenable and that its vagueness concerns are mis\nplaced. The Government contends that \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s re\nstriction on advice to incur more debt \u201cin contemplation of\u201d\nbankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to\nundertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system. Focus\ning first on the provision\u2019s text, the Government points to\nsources indicating that the phrase \u201cin contemplation of\u201d\nbankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated\nwith abusive conduct. For instance, Black\u2019s Law Diction\nary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) defines \u201ccon\ntemplation of bankruptcy\u201d as \u201c[t]he thought of declaring\nbankruptcy because of the inability to continue current\nfinancial operations, often coupled with action designed to\nthwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceed\ning.\u201d Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illus\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrates that traditional coupling. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 98\u2013\n65, p. 9 (1983) (discussing the practice of \u201c \u2018loading up\u2019 [on\ndebt] in contemplation of bankruptcy\u201d); Report of the\nCommission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States,\nH. R. Doc. No. 93\u2013137, pt. I, p. 11 (1973) (\u201c[T]he most\nserious abuse of consumer bankruptcy is the number of\ninstances in which individuals have purchased a sizable\nquantity of goods and services on credit on the eve of\nbankruptcy in contemplation of obtaining a discharge\u201d).\nThe Government also points to early American and Eng\nlish judicial decisions to corroborate its contention that \u201cin\ncontemplation of\u201d bankruptcy signifies abusive conduct.\nSee, e.g., In re Pearce, 19 F. Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt.\n1843); Morgan v. Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296\u2013297, 110\nEng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).\n   To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on\n\u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s immediate context. According to the Govern\nment, the other three subsections of \u00a7526(a) are designed\nto protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief\nagencies: \u00a7526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to per\nform all promised services; \u00a7526(a)(2) prohibits them from\nmaking or advising debtors to make false or misleading\nstatements in bankruptcy; and \u00a7526(a)(3) prohibits them\nfrom misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of\nbankruptcy. When \u00a7526(a)(4) is read in context of these\ndebtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,\nconstruing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving\nadvice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors\nseems particularly nonsensical.\n   Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA\u2019s\nremedies for violations of \u00a7526(a)(4) similarly corroborate\nits narrow reading. Section 526(c) provides remedies for a\ndebt relief agency\u2019s violation of \u00a7526, \u00a7527, or \u00a7528.\nAmong the actions authorized, a debtor may sue the at\ntorney for remittal of fees, actual damages, and reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs; a state attorney general may sue\n\f12    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nfor a resident\u2019s actual damages; and a court finding inten\ntional abuse may impose an appropriate civil penalty.\n\u00a7526(c). The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in Hersh v. United States ex rel. Mukasey, 553\nF. 3d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton\u2019s dissent below for\nthe observation that \u201cCongress\u2019s emphasis on actual dam\nages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests\nthat Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to\ndebtors which if followed would have a significant risk of\nharming the debtor.\u201d Id., at 760; see 541 F. 3d, at 800\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By\ncontrast, \u201clegal and appropriate advice that would be\nprotected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a\nbroad reading of \u00a7526(a)(4), should cause no damage at\nall.\u201d Ibid.; see Hersh, 541 F. 3d, at 760.\n   Milavetz contends that the Government\u2019s sources actu\nally undermine its claim that the phrase \u201cin contemplation\nof\u201d bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct.\nSpecifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities illus\ntrate that \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy is a neutral\nphrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to\nan additional, proscriptive term. As Black\u2019s states, the\nphrase is \u201coften coupled with action designed to thwart the\ndistribution of assets\u201d in bankruptcy, Black\u2019s 336 (empha\nsis added), but it carries no independent connotation of\nabuse. In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on\nour decision in Pender, 289 U. S. 472, contending that we\nconstrued \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy in that case to\ndescribe \u201cconduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy\nfiling and nothing more.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 61.\n   After reviewing these competing claims, we are per\nsuaded that a narrower reading of \u00a7526(a)(4) is sounder,\nalthough we do not adopt precisely the view the Govern\nment advocates. The Government\u2019s sources show that the\nphrase \u201cin contemplation of\u201d bankruptcy has so commonly\nbeen associated with abusive conduct that it may readily\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe understood to prefigure abuse. As used in \u00a7526(a)(4),\nhowever, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of\nmisconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the\nbankruptcy system. In light of our decision in Pender, and\nin context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that\n\u00a7526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising\na debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for\nbankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.\n    Pender addressed the meaning of former \u00a796(d), which\nauthorized reexamination of a debtor\u2019s payment of attor\nney\u2019s fees \u201cin contemplation of the filing of a petition.\u201d\nRecognizing \u201c \u2018the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too\nliberally with his property in enabling counsel to protect\nhim,\u2019 \u201d 289 U. S., at 478 (quoting In re Wood & Henderson,\n210 U. S. 246, 253 (1908)), we read \u201cin contemplation of\n. . . filing\u201d in that context to require that the portended\nbankruptcy have \u201cinduce[d]\u201d the transfer at issue, 289\nU. S., at 477, understanding inducement to engender\nsuspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we identi\nfied the \u201ccontrolling question\u201d as \u201cwhether the thought of\nbankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.\u201d\nIbid. Given the substantial similarities between \u00a7\u00a796(d)\nand 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the\nlatter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason\nfor \u201cadvis[ing] an assisted person . . . to incur more debt\u201d\nwas the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.\n    To be sure, there are relevant differences between the\nprovision at issue in Pender and the one now under re\nview. Most notably, the inquiry in Pender was as to pay\nments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas \u00a7526(a)(4)\nregards advice to incur additional debts. Consistent with\nthat difference, under \u00a796(d) a finding that a payment was\nmade \u201cin contemplation of\u201d filing resolved only a threshold\ninquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of\nthe payment; the finding thus supported an inference of\nabuse but did not conclusively establish it. By contrast,\n\f14    MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadvice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as pro\nhibited by \u00a7526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to\n\u201cload up\u201d on debt with the expectation of obtaining its\ndischarge\u2014i.e., conduct that is abusive per se.\n   The statutory context supports the conclusion that\n\u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition primarily targets this type of\nabuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already\nsought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior\nto filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the\nattendant risk of manipulation by preventing the dis\ncharge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making\ndebts for purchases of luxury goods or services presump\ntively nondischargeable. See \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000\ned.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, how\never, by providing a new mechanism for determining a\ndebtor\u2019s ability to repay. Pursuant to the \u201cmeans tes[t],\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor\u2019s petition for Chapter 7\nrelief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dis\nmissed or converted to a structured repayment plan under\nChapter 13) if the debtor\u2019s current monthly income ex\nceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including pay\nments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed\namount. See \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(iv). The test promotes\ndebtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur\nadditional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured\ndebts offset a debtor\u2019s monthly income under the formula.\nOther amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a\nconcern with this practice.        For instance, Congress\namended \u00a7523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge\nby lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor\nmust assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under\n\u00a7523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling win\ndow. See \u00a7310, 119 Stat. 84. In context, \u00a7526(a)(4) is best\nunderstood to provide an additional safeguard against the\npractice of loading up on debt prior to filing.\n   The Government\u2019s contextual arguments provide addi\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional support for the view that \u00a7526(a)(4) was meant to\nprevent this type of conduct. The companion rules of\nprofessional conduct in \u00a7\u00a7526(a)(1)\u2013(3) and the remedies\nfor their violation in \u00a7526(c) indicate that Congress was\nconcerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or\ncreditors. Unlike the reasonable financial advice the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s broad reading would proscribe, advice to\nincur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a sub\nstantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors. See\nHersh, 553 F. 3d, at 760\u2013761. Specifically, the incurrence\nof such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition\nconduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargable,\nsee \u00a7523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or\ndismiss it altogether, see \u00a7707(b), thereby defeating his\neffort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although\nmanipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abu\nsive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm\nas a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of\nthe bankruptcy estate. By contrast, the prudent advice\nthat the Eighth Circuit\u2019s view of the statute forbids would\nlikely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very\nleast should cause no harm. See id., at 760; 541 F. 3d, at\n800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). For all of these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7526(a)(4)\nprohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an as\nsisted person to incur more debt when the impelling rea\nson for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\n   That \u201c[n]o other solution yields as sensible a\u201d result\nfurther persuades us of the correctness of this narrow\nreading. United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 55\n(1994). It would make scant sense to prevent attorneys\nand other debt relief agencies from advising individuals\nthinking of filing for bankruptcy about options that would\nbe beneficial to both those individuals and their creditors.\nThat construction serves none of the purposes of the Bank\nruptcy Code or the amendments enacted through the\n\f16      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBAPCPA. Milavetz itself acknowledges that its expansive\nview of \u00a7526(a)(4) would produce absurd results; that is\none of its bases for arguing that \u201cdebt relief agency\u201d should\nbe construed to exclude attorneys. Because the language\nand context of \u00a7526(a)(4) evidence a more targeted pur\npose, we can avoid the absurdity of which Milavetz com\nplains without reaching the result it advocates.\n   For the same reason, we reject Milavetz\u2019s suggestion\nthat \u00a7526(a)(4) broadly prohibits debt relief agencies from\ndiscussing covered subjects instead of merely proscribing\naffirmative advice to undertake a particular action. Sec\ntion 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies\nonly from \u201cadvis[ing]\u201d assisted persons \u201cto incur\u201d more\ndebt. Covered professionals remain free to \u201ctal[k] fully\nand candidly about the incurrence of debt in contempla\ntion of filing a bankruptcy case.\u201d Brief for Milavetz 73.\nSection 526(a)(4) requires professionals only to avoid\ninstructing or encouraging assisted persons to take on\nmore debt in that circumstance.

ABA Model Rule of\nProfessional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (\u201cA lawyer shall not\ncounsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct\nthat the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a\nlawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any pro\nposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or\nassist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the\nvalidity, scope, meaning or application of the law\u201d). Even\nif the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach\nthe same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition\nof frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within\nthe statutory scheme. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 529\nU. S. 694, 706, n. 9 (2000).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If read as Milavetz advocates, \u00a7526(a)(4) would seriously undermine\n\nthe attorney-client relationship. Earlier this Term, we acknowledged\nthe importance of the attorney-client privilege as a means of protecting\nthat relationship and fostering robust discussion. See Mohawk Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7). Reiter\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, we reject Milavetz\u2019s contention that, narrowly\nconstrued, \u00a7526(a)(4) is impermissibly vague. Milavetz\nurges that the concept of abusive prefiling conduct is too\nindefinite to withstand constitutional scrutiny and that\nuncertainty regarding the scope of the prohibition will\nchill protected speech. We disagree.\n   Under our reading of the statute, of course, the prohib\nited advice is not defined in terms of abusive prefiling\nconduct but rather the incurrence of additional debt when\nthe impelling reason is the anticipation of bankruptcy.\nEven if the test depended upon the notion of abuse, how\never, Milavetz\u2019s claim would be fatally undermined by\nother provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, to which that\nconcept is no stranger. As discussed above, the Code\nauthorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge\nfraudulent debts, see \u00a7523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or\nconvert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that\ngranting relief would constitute abuse, see \u00a7707(b)(1).\nAttorneys and other professionals who give debtors bank\nruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their\nconsequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs addi\ntional debt prior to filing. Indeed, \u00a7707(b)(4)(C) states that\nan attorney\u2019s signature on bankruptcy filings \u201cshall consti\ntute a certification that the attorney has\u201d determined that\nthe filing \u201cdoes not constitute an abuse under [\u00a7707(b)(1)].\u201d\nAgainst this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that\nnarrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising\na client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct\ncould chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client\nrelationship. Our construction of \u00a7526(a)(4) to prevent\nonly advice principally motivated by the prospect of bank\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nating the significance of such dialogue, we note that \u00a7526(a)(4), as\n\nnarrowly construed, presents no impediment to \u201c \u2018full and frank\u2019 \u201d \n\ndiscussions. Ibid. (quoting Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383,\n\n389 (1981)). \n\n\f18      MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nruptcy further ensures that professionals cannot unknow\ningly run afoul of its proscription.6 Because the scope of\nthe prohibition is adequately defined, both on its own\nterms and by reference to the Code\u2019s other provisions, we\nreject Milavetz\u2019s vagueness claim.\n  As the foregoing shows, the language of the statute,\ntogether with other evidence of its purpose, makes this\nnarrow reading of \u00a7526(a)(4) not merely a plausible inter\npretation but the more natural one. Accordingly, we reject\nthe Eighth Circuit\u2019s conclusion and hold that a debt relief\nagency violates \u00a7526(a)(4) only when the impetus of the\nadvice to incur more debt is the expectation of filing for\nbankruptcy and obtaining the attendant relief. Because\nour reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for\nreversing the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, and because\nMilavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as\nnarrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further\nconsider whether the statute so construed withstands\nFirst Amendment scrutiny.\n                          C\n  Finally, we address the validity of \u00a7528\u2019s challenged\ndisclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits regarding the permissi\n\nbility of advice to incur debt in certain circumstances, see Brief for\nMilavetz 48\u201351, are easily answered by reference to whether the\nexpectation of filing for bankruptcy (and obtaining a discharge) im\npelled the advice. We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of\nbankruptcy is insufficient to trigger \u00a7526(a)(4)\u2019s prohibition. Instead,\nthat provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is princi\npally motivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mort\ngage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will\nreduce the debtor\u2019s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not\nprohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than\nthe anticipated filing, is the impelling cause. Advice to incur additional\ndebt to buy groceries, pay medical bills, or make other purchases\n\u201creasonably necessary for the support or maintenance of the debtor or a\ndependent of the debtor,\u201d \u00a7523(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), is similarly permissible.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion is to determine the contours of Milavetz\u2019s claim.\nAlthough the nature of its challenge is not entirely clear\nfrom the briefing or decisions below, counsel for Milavetz\ninsisted at oral argument that this is \u201cnot a facial chal\nlenge; it\u2019s an as-applied challenge.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.\nWe will approach the question consistent with Milavetz\u2019s\ncharacterization.7\n   We next consider the standard of scrutiny applicable to\n\u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements. The parties agree, as do\nwe, that the challenged provisions regulate only commer\ncial speech. Milavetz contends that our decision in Cen\ntral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), supplies the proper standard\nfor reviewing these requirements. The Court in that case\nheld that restrictions on nonmisleading commercial speech\nregarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate\nscrutiny\u2014that is, they must \u201cdirectly advanc[e]\u201d a sub\nstantial governmental interest and be \u201cn[o] more extensive\nthan is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d Id., at 566.\nContesting Milavetz\u2019s premise, the Government maintains\nthat \u00a7528 is directed at misleading commercial speech.\nFor that reason, and because the challenged provisions\nimpose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirma\ntive limitation on speech, the Government contends that\nthe less exacting scrutiny described in Zauderer governs\nour review. We agree.\n   Zauderer addressed the validity of a rule of professional\nconduct that required attorneys who advertised contin\ngency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that\na losing client might still be responsible for certain litiga\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate \u00a7528\u2019s validity as\n\napplied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record.\nBecause the parties have introduced no exhibits or other evidence to\nground our analysis, we are guided in this preenforcement challenge\nonly by Milavetz\u2019s status\u2014i.e., as a law firm or attorney\u2014and its\ngeneral claims about the nature of its advertisements.\n\f20     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                         STATES\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntion fees and costs. Noting that First Amendment protec\ntion for commercial speech is justified in large part by the\ninformation\u2019s value to consumers, the Court concluded\nthat an attorney\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in not\nproviding the required factual information is \u201cminimal.\u201d\n471 U. S., at 651. Unjustified or unduly burdensome\ndisclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by\nchilling protected speech, but \u201can advertiser\u2019s rights are\nadequately protected as long as disclosure requirements\nare reasonably related to the State\u2019s interest in preventing\ndeception of consumers.\u201d Ibid.\n   The challenged provisions of \u00a7528 share the essential\nfeatures of the rule at issue in Zauderer. As in that case,\n\u00a7528\u2019s required disclosures are intended to combat the\nproblem of inherently misleading commercial advertise\nments\u2014specifically, the promise of debt relief without any\nreference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which\nhas inherent costs. Additionally, the disclosures entail\nonly an accurate statement identifying the advertiser\u2019s\nlegal status and the character of the assistance provided,\nand they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz\nfrom conveying any additional information.\n   The same characteristics of \u00a7528 that make it analogous\nto the rule in Zauderer serve to distinguish it from those\nat issue in In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191 (1982), to which\nthe Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of Central\nHudson. The ethical rules addressed in R. M. J. prohib\nited attorneys from advertising their practice areas in\nterms other than those prescribed by the State Supreme\nCourt and from announcing the courts in which they were\nadmitted to practice. See 455 U. S., at 197\u2013198. Finding\nthat the restricted statements were not inherently mis\nleading and that the State had failed to show that the\nappellant\u2019s advertisements were themselves likely to\nmislead consumers, see id., at 205, the Court applied\nCentral Hudson\u2019s intermediate scrutiny and invalidated\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe restrictions as insufficiently tailored to any substan\ntial state interest, 455 U. S., at 205\u2013206. In so holding,\nthe Court emphasized that States retain authority to\nregulate inherently misleading advertisements, particu\nlarly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that\nadvertisements for professional services pose a special risk\nof deception. See id., at 203, 207.\n   Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government\nin these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that\nits advertisements are misleading. Zauderer forecloses\nthat argument: \u201cWhen the possibility of deception is as\nself-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the\nState to \u2018conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may]\ndetermine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to\nmislead.\u2019 \u201d 471 U. S., at 652\u2013653 (quoting FTC v. Colgate-\nPalmolive Co., 380 U. S. 374, 391\u2013392 (1965)). Evidence\nin the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of\nadvertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief\nwithout alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998\nHearings, pt. III, at 86, 90\u201394, is adequate to establish\nthat the likelihood of deception in this case \u201cis hardly a\nspeculative one,\u201d 471 U. S., at 652.\n   Milavetz alternatively argues that the term \u201cdebt relief\nagency\u201d is confusing and misleading and that requiring its\ninclusion in advertisements cannot be \u201creasonably related\u201d\nto the Government\u2019s interest in preventing consumer\ndeception, as Zauderer requires. Id., at 651. This conten\ntion amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz\u2019s\npart for referring to itself as something other than a \u201cdebt\nrelief agency\u201d\u2014e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several\nreasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any consti\ntutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to sup\nport its claim that the label is confusing. Because \u00a7528 by\nits terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclo\nsures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt\nrelief agencies must identify themselves as such in their\n\f22     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED\n                         STATES\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nadvertisements. This statement provides interested ob\nservers with pertinent information about the advertiser\u2019s\nservices and client obligations.\n   Other information that Milavetz must or may include in\nits advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services\nprovides additional assurance that consumers will not\nmisunderstand the term. The required statement that the\nadvertiser \u201c \u2018help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief\u2019 \u201d gives\nmeaningful context to the term \u201cdebt relief agency.\u201d And\nMilavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attor\nney. Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor\nthe disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as\nthe resulting statements are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the\nstatutory examples. \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).\n   Finally, we reject Milavetz\u2019s argument that \u00a7528 is not\nreasonably related to any governmental interest because it\napplies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as\nMilavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Mi\nlavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading\nin that context. This claim is premised on an untenable\nreading of the statute. We think it evident from the defi\nnition of \u201cassisted person\u201d\u2014which is stated in terms of the\nperson\u2019s debts, see \u00a7101(3)\u2014and from the text and struc\nture of the debt-relief-agency provisions in \u00a7\u00a7526, 527, and\n528 that those provisions, including \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure\nrequirements, govern only professionals who offer bank\nruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528\nis itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertain\ning to \u201cbankruptcy assistance services,\u201d \u201cthe benefits of\nbankruptcy,\u201d \u201cexcessive debt, debt collection pressure, or\ninability to pay any consumer debt,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7528(a)(3) and (b)(2).\nMoreover, like the other debt-relief-agency provisions, that\nsection is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code\nentitled \u201cDEBTOR\u2019S DUTIES AND BENEFITS.\u201d                      11\nU.

Once\nagain, we decline Milavetz\u2019s invitation to adopt a view of\nthe statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would\nproduce an absurd result.\n   Because \u00a7528\u2019s requirements that Milavetz identify\nitself as a debt relief agency and include certain informa\ntion about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services\nare \u201creasonably related to the [Government\u2019s] interest in\npreventing deception of consumers,\u201d Zauderer, 471 U. S.,\nat 651, we uphold those provisions as applied to Milavetz.\n                            IV\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed as to \u00a7\u00a7101(12A)\nand 528 and reversed as to \u00a7526(a)(4), and the cases are\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The Court first notes that\nstatements in the Report of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary \u201cindicate concern with abusive practices under\ntaken by attorneys.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3. Perhaps, but only\nthe concern of the author of the Report. Such statements\ntell us nothing about what the statute means, since (1) we\ndo not know that the members of the Committee read the\nReport, (2) it is almost certain that they did not vote on\nthe Report (that is not the practice), and (3) even if they\ndid read and vote on it, they were not, after all, those who\nmade this law. The statute before us is a law because its\ntext was approved by a majority vote of the House and the\nSenate, and was signed by the President. Even indulging\nthe extravagant assumption that Members of the House\n\f2       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v.

And the President\nsurely had more important things to do.\n  The footnote\u2019s other source of legislative history is truly\nmystifying. For the proposition that \u201cthe legislative record\nelsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys\u201d which was\npresumably the concern of Congress, the Court cites a\nreproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an\nattachment to the written statement of a witness, (2) in a\nhearing held seven years prior to this statute\u2019s passage,\n(3) before a subcommittee of the House considering a\ndifferent consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never\npassed.* \u201cElsewhere\u201d indeed.\n  The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by\nthis superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is \u201cunnec\nessary in light of the statute\u2019s unambiguous language,\u201d\nante, at 6, n. 3). But much can be lost. Our cases have\nsaid that legislative history is irrelevant when the statu\ntory text is clear. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzales, 520\nU. S. 1, 6 (1997); Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992). The footnote advises conscientious\nattorneys that this is not true, and that they must spend\ntime and their clients\u2019 treasure combing the annals of\nlegislative history in all cases: To buttress their case\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court protests that the earlier hearing was \u201cpart of the record\ncited by the 2005 House Report,\u201d ante, at 6, n. 3. The page it cites,\nhowever, does nothing more than note that the earlier hearing took\nplace, see H. R. Rep. No. 109\u201331, pt. 1, p. 7 (2005). Are we to believe\nthat this brought to the attention of the committee (much less of the\nwhole Congress) an attachment to the testimony of one of the witnesses\nat that long-ago hearing? Of course not. That legislative history shows\nwhat \u201cCongress\u201d intended is a fiction requiring no support in reality.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

We have\nrefused in other contexts to attach any \u201cconstitutional\nsignificance\u201d to the difference between regulations that\ncompel protected speech and regulations that restrict it.\nSee, e.g., Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C.,\nInc., 487 U. S. 781, 796\u2013797 (1988). I see no reason why\nthat difference should acquire constitutional significance\nmerely because the regulations at issue involve commer\ncial speech. See Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,\nInc., 521 U. S. 457, 480\u2013481 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(arguing that \u201ccommercial speech is . . . subject to [this]\nFirst Amendment principle: that compelling cognizable\nspeech officially is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is\ntypically subject to the same level of scrutiny\u201d); id., at 504\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); cf. United States v. United Foods,\nInc., 533 U. S. 405, 419 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(stating that regulations that compel funding for commer\ncial advertising \u201cmust be subjected to the most stringent\nFirst Amendment scrutiny\u201d).\n   Accordingly, I would be willing to reexamine Zauderer\nand its progeny in an appropriate case to determine\nwhether these precedents provide sufficient First Amend\nment protection against government-mandated disclo\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nsures.1 Because no party asks us to do so here, however, I\nagree with the Court that the Zauderer standard governs\nour review of the challenge to \u00a7528 brought by the Milav\netz law firm and the other plaintiffs in this action (herein\nafter Milavetz).\n  Yet even under Zauderer, we \u201chave not presumptively\nendorsed\u201d laws requiring the use of \u201cgovernment-scripted\ndisclaimers\u201d in commercial advertising. See Borgner v.\nFlorida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud\nerer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor\nney under a rule of professional conduct that required\nadvertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose\nthat losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees\nand costs. See 471 U. S., at 650\u2013653. Importantly, how\never, Zauderer\u2019s advertisement was found to be misleading\non its face, and the regulation in that case did not man\ndate the specific form or text of the disclosure. Ibid. Thus,\nZauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov\nernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted\ndisclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are\n\nfalse or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be\nproscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520\n(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nFurthermore, I acknowledge this Court\u2019s longstanding assumption that\na consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain\nfactual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on\nFirst Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver\ntisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,\n771\u2013772 (1976); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme\nCourt of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 651\u2013652, n. 14 (1985); Riley v. National\nFederation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 796, n. 9 (1988);\nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447\nU. S. 557, 565 (1980). But even if that assumption is correct, I doubt\nthat it justifies an entirely different standard of review for regulations\nthat compel, rather than suppress, commercial speech.\n\f4     MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                        STATES\n\n                  Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\npreventing consumer deception might plausibly be at\nstake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government\nthat a disclosure requirement is \u201cintended\u201d to prevent\nconsumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to\nuphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls\nwithin its sweep. See ante, at 20.\n   Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations\naimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissi\nble only where \u201cthe particular advertising is inherently\nlikely to deceive or where the record indicates that a par\nticular form or method of advertising has in fact been\ndeceptive.\u201d In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 202 (1982) (em\nphasis added); see Zauderer, supra, at 651 (\u201crecogniz[ing]\nthat unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re\nquirements might offend the First Amendment\u201d). There\nfore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional mus\nter only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements\nthat, by their nature, possess these traits. See R. M. J.,\nsupra, at 202; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and\nProfessional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S.\n136, 143, 146\u2013147 (1994).\n   I do not read the Court\u2019s opinion to hold otherwise. See\nante, at 20. Accordingly, and with that understanding, I\nturn to the question whether Milavetz\u2019s challenge to\n\u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements survives Zauderer scrutiny\non the record before us.\n   As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz\u2019s challenge\ninhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See\nante, at 19, n. 7. Milavetz challenged \u00a7528\u2019s constitution\nality before the statute had ever been enforced against any\nof the firm\u2019s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports\nto challenge \u00a7528 only \u201c \u2018as-applied\u2019 \u201d to its own advertis\ning, see ante, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or\nexhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen\na sampling of Milavetz\u2019s advertisements or even a declara\ntion describing their contents and the media through\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwhich Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence,\nMilavetz\u2019s nominal \u201cas applied\u201d challenge appears strik\ningly similar to a facial challenge.\n   We generally disapprove of such challenges because\nthey \u201coften rest on speculation\u201d and require courts to\nengage in \u201c \u2018premature interpretation of statutes on the\nbasis of factually barebones records.\u2019 \u201d Washington State\nGrange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.\n442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.\n600, 609 (2004)). Milavetz\u2019s claim invites the same prob\nlems. Milavetz alleges that \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure require\nments are unconstitutional as applied to its advertise\nments because its advertisements are not misleading and\nbecause the disclaimer required by \u00a7528 will create, rather\nthan reduce, confusion for Milavetz\u2019s potential clients.\nThat may well be true. But because no record evidence of\nMilavetz\u2019s advertisements exists to guide our review, we\ncan only speculate about the ways in which the statute\nmight be applied to Milavetz\u2019s speech.\n   When forced to determine the constitutionality of a\nstatute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the\nlaw if there is any \u201cconceivabl[e]\u201d manner in which it can\nbe enforced consistent with the First Amendment. Wash\nington State Grange, supra, at 456. In this case, both\nparties agree that \u00a7528\u2019s disclosure requirements cover, at\na minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to\n\u201c \u2018wipe out\u2019 \u201d debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the\nmeans of accomplishing this goal.2 Brief for Milavetz 82,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Atoral argument, Milavetz\u2019s counsel declined to describe Milavetz\u2019s\nchallenge to \u00a7528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25\u201326,\nand Milavetz\u2019s briefs make no such contention. But even viewing\nMilavetz\u2019s argument as a claim that \u00a7528 is facially overbroad because\nit applies to nonmisleading advertisements for bankruptcy-related\nservices, such an argument must fail. First, as noted, Milavetz ac\nknowledges that \u00a7528 can be constitutionally applied to deceptive\nbankruptcy-related advertisements and, thus, at least one \u201cset of\n\f6       MILAVETZ, GALLOP & MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED \n\n                          STATES\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\n86; Brief for United States 60\u201362. As a result, there is at\nleast one set of facts on which the statute could be consti\ntutionally applied. Thus, I agree with the Court that\nMilavetz\u2019s challenge to \u00a7528 must fail.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncircumstances exists under which [\u00a7528] would be valid.\u201d United States \n\nv. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Second, Milavetz does not at\ntempt to argue that \u00a7528\u2019s unconstitutional applications are \u201csubstan\ntial\u201d in number when judged in relation to this \u201cplainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Washington State Grange v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013728.     Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 8, 2010\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) requires a criminal defendant\u2019s trial\n  to commence within 70 days of his indictment or initial appearance,\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\n  that deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). As relevant here, the Act\n  automatically excludes from the 70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from\n  . . . proceedings concerning the defendant,\u201d 18 U. S. C. A. \u00a73161(h)(1)\n  (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)), and separately permits a district court\n  to exclude \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance\u201d it grants, provided\n  the court makes findings required by \u00a73161(h)(7) (hereinafter subsec\n  tion (h)(7)). Petitioner\u2019s indictment on federal firearm and drug pos\n  session charges started the 70-day clock on August 24, 2006. After\n  petitioner\u2019s arraignment, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to\n  file pretrial motions by September 13. On September 7, the court\n  granted petitioner\u2019s motion to extend that deadline, but on the new\n  due date, September 25, petitioner waived his right to file pretrial\n  motions. On October 4, the Magistrate Judge found the waiver vol\n  untary and intelligent. Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial\n  was delayed several times, often at petitioner\u2019s instigation. On Feb\n  ruary 19, 2007\u2014179 days after he was indicted\u2014he moved to dismiss\n  the indictment, claiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. In\n  denying the motion, the District Court excluded the time from Sep\n  tember 7 through October 4 as pretrial motion preparation time. At\n  trial, petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to\n  concurrent prison terms. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial of\n  the motion to dismiss, holding that the period from September 7\n  through October 4 was automatically excludable from the 70-day\n  limit under subsection (h)(1).\nHeld: The time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically\n\f2                      BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    excludable from the 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1). Such time\n    may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance\n    based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7). Pp. 6\u201318.\n       (a) The delay at issue is governed by subsection (h)(1)(D) (hereinaf\n    ter subparagraph (D)), the enumerated category that renders auto\n    matically excludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\n    the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\n    other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d This provision communi\n    cates Congress\u2019 judgment that pretrial motion-related delay is auto\n    matically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed\n    through a specified hearing or disposition point, and that other pre\n    trial motion-related delay is excludable only if it results in a continu\n    ance under subsection (h)(7). This limitation is significant because\n    Congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s\n    enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired. Although the pe\n    riod of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results\n    from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period pre\n    cedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay\n    may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically exclud\n    able. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) This analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry be\n    cause \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here, subparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s]\n    of more general application\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)).\n    Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. A contrary result\n    would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the pro\n    priety of this Court\u2019s approach. Subsection (h)(1)\u2019s phrase \u201cincluding\n    but not limited to\u201d does not show that subsection (h)(1) permits auto\n    matic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of pro\n    ceedings, but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph\n    expressly addressed to that category. That would confuse the illus\n    trative nature of the subsection\u2019s list of categories with the contents\n    of the categories themselves. Reading the \u201cincluding but not limited\n    to\u201d clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as\n    well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction\n    principles by ignoring subsection (h)(1)\u2019s structure and grammar and\n    in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs inde\n    terminate and virtually superfluous. See generally id., at 410. Sub\n    section (h)(1)\u2019s context supports this Court\u2019s conclusion. Subsection\n    (h)(7) provides that delay \u201cresulting from a continuance granted by\n    any judge\u201d may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends\n    of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of\n    the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,\u201d and records those\n    findings. In setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection\n    (h)(7) continuance, Congress twice recognized the importance of ade\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  quate pretrial preparation time.               See \u00a7\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii),\n  3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). The Court\u2019s determination that the delay at issue\n  is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7),\n  and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only\n  where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion. The\n  Court\u2019s precedents also support this reading of subsection (h)(1). See\n  Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 502. Pp. 10\u201316.\n     (c) The Act does not force a district court to choose between reject\n  ing a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare pretrial motions and\n  risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the\n  trial. A court may still exclude preparation time under subsection\n  (h)(7) by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\n  findings. Subsection (h)(7) provides \u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d\n  Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498, giving district courts \u201cdiscretion . . . to ac\n  commodate limited delays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The\n  Government suggests that a district court may fail to make the nec\n  essary subsection (h)(7) findings, leading to a windfall gain for a de\n  fendant who induces delay beyond the 70-day limit. But dismissal\n  need not represent a windfall. If the court dismisses the charges\n  without prejudice, the Government may refile charges or reindict. In\n  ruling on a motion to dismiss under the Act, the district court should\n  consider, inter alia, the party responsible for the delay. Pp. 16\u201318.\n     (d) This Court does not consider whether any of the Act\u2019s other ex\n  clusions would apply to all or part of the September 7 through Octo\n  ber 4 period that is not automatically excludable under subsection\n  (h)(1).

S. C. \u00a73161 et seq., requires that a criminal defen\ndant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days after he is charged\nor makes an initial appearance, whichever is later, see\n\u00a73161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if\nthat deadline is not met, \u00a73162(a)(2). The Act, however,\nexcludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain\nenumerated events. \u00a73161(h). As relevant here, \u201cdelay\nresulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d\nis automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calcu\nlation.1 18 U. S. C.

For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1),\nCongress already has determined that the benefit of such delay out\nweighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case.\nThe word \u201cautomatic\u201d serves as a useful shorthand. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Lucky, 569 F. 3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (\u201cSome exclusions are\nautomatic. Other exclusions require judicial action\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\f2                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nter subsection (h)(1)).

S. ___\n(2009), and now reverse.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  On August 2, 2006, police officers surveilling an apart\nment building for drug activity saw petitioner and his\ngirlfriend enter a car parked in front of the building and\ndrive away. After observing petitioner commit several\ntraffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle. They\napproached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine\non petitioner\u2019s lap. After the officers read petitioner his\nMiranda warnings, petitioner made inculpatory state\nments. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\nPetitioner denied any association with the apartment\nbuilding where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend\nadmitted that she lived there and consented to a search of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 After the Eighth Circuit issued its decision below, Congress passed\n\nthe Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 4291, which made technical changes to the Speedy Trial Act,\nincluding the renumbering of several provisions. The amendments did\nnot change the substance of any provision relevant here. Accordingly,\nin this opinion, including our discussions of the orders and decisions\nunder review, we refer only to the current version of the Act.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The officers who conducted the search\nuncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, in\ncluding an identification card, cocaine, three firearms,\nammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested\npetitioner the next day.\n   On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being\na felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional pos\nsession with intent to distribute more than five grams of\ncocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1). The August\n24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day clock.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1). After petitioner\u2019s arraignment\non September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling\norder requiring, inter alia, that the parties file pretrial\nmotions by September 13.\n   On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to\nSeptember 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion\nand extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond\npetitioner\u2019s request, to September 25. On September 25,\nhowever, petitioner filed a \u201cWaiver of Pretrial Motions\u201d\nadvising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial\nmotions.\n   On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to\nconsider petitioner\u2019s \u201cwaiver,\u201d at which petitioner con\nfirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial\nmotions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found\nthat petitioner\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.\n   Over the next three months, petitioner\u2019s trial was de\nlayed for several reasons. Though these delays are not\ndirectly relevant to the question presented here, we re\ncount them to explain the full context in which that ques\ntion arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue\nthe trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional\ntime to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the\nmotion and reset the trial for December 18.\n\f4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The parties then met informally and prepared a plea\nagreement, which they provided to the court. The District\nCourt scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20.\nAt the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement\nthe agreement and requested a new attorney. The District\nCourt rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted\npetitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent motion to withdraw,\nand appointed new counsel.\n   On February 19, 2007\u2014179 days after petitioner was\nindicted\u2014petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment,\nclaiming that the Act\u2019s 70-day limit had elapsed. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion. In calculating how\nmany of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the\nDistrict Judge excluded the period from September 7\nthrough October 4 as \u201cwithin the extension of time\ngranted to file pretrial motions.\u201d3         Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.\n   In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on\nthe District Court\u2019s docket, which required the court to\nreschedule petitioner\u2019s trial. After obtaining the consent\nof the parties and finding that a continuance would serve\nthe public interest, the District Court continued peti\ntioner\u2019s trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Peti\ntioner\u2019s 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found\npetitioner guilty on both counts and the District Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In addition, the District Judge excluded the continuance granted on\n\nNovember 9 (resetting the trial for December 18) under \u00a73161(h)(7)(A),\nand excluded the time from November 9 through December 20 as delay\nresulting from a plea agreement under \u00a73161(h)(1)(G). He further\nexcluded the time from December 20 through February 26 \u201cas it . . .\nresulted from [petitioner\u2019s] election not to implement a plea agreement,\nand his request to the court to have new counsel appointed for him.\u201d\nOrder in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 3. The judge stated\non the record that these continuances were necessary to ensure that\n\u201cthe ends of justice could more properly be served\u201d and \u201cobviously\noutweighed the best interest of the public and the defendant to a\nSpeedy Trial.\u201d Ibid.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

As relevant, the\nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the\ntime from September 7 (the original deadline for filing\npretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court\nheld a hearing on petitioner\u2019s decision to waive the right to\nfile pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day\nlimit. Although the District Court did not identify which\nprovision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of\nAppeals held that \u201cpretrial motion preparation time\u201d is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1)\u2014which\ncovers \u201cdelay resulting from other proceedings concerning\nthe defendant\u201d\u2014as long as \u201cthe [district] court specifically\ngrants time for that purpose.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.4 In\nreaching this conclusion, the Eighth Circuit joined seven\nother Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1)\nthe same way.5 Two Courts of Appeals, the Fourth and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In addition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s order\nexcluding the time from November 9 to, and including, December 18\nand from December 20 to, and including, February 23 as delays result\ning from continuances under \u00a73161(h)(7) and \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv), respec\ntively. The Court of Appeals did not address whether to exclude De\ncember 19. Nor did it decide whether to exclude the delay from\nFebruary 23 to March 5, because even if those days were included,\n\u201conly 58 days passed between [petitioner]\u2019s indictment and trial, fewer\nthan the 70 allowed by the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 900.\n   5 See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSixth Circuits, interpret subsection (h)(1) differently,\nholding that time for preparing pretrial motions is outside\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s scope.6 We granted certiorari to resolve\nthis conflict.\n                              II\n   As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s trial commence within 70 days of a defen\ndant\u2019s initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from\nthe 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay.\nSection 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are ex\ncludable from the calculation. Some of these delays are\nexcludable only if the district court makes certain findings\nenumerated in the statute. See \u00a73161(h)(7). Other delays\nare automatically excludable, i.e., they may be excluded\nwithout district court findings. As relevant here, subsec\ntion (h)(1) requires the automatic exclusion of \u201c[a]ny pe\nriod of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning\nthe defendant, including but not limited to\u201d periods of\ndelay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of\nproceedings.7 The Government contends that the time the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nTibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985); United States v.

We disagree, and conclude that such time may be\nexcluded only when a district court enters appropriate\nfindings under subsection (h)(7).\n                             A\n  The eight subparagraphs in subsection (h)(1) address\nthe automatic excludability of delay generated for certain\nenumerated purposes. Thus, we first consider whether\nthe delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these\nsubparagraphs. It is.\n  The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner suffi\ncient time to file pretrial motions.8 Subsection (h)(1)(D)\n(hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically\nexcludable \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d\nRead, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201c(D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the\nmotion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion;\n\u201c(E) delay resulting from any proceeding relating to the transfer of a\ncase or the removal of any defendant from another district under the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n\u201c(F) delay resulting from transportation of any defendant from another\ndistrict, or to and from places of examination or hospitalization, except\nthat any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of\nremoval or an order directing such transportation, and the defendant\u2019s\narrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable;\n\u201c(G) delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea\nagreement to be entered into by the defendant and the attorney for the\nGovernment; and\n\u201c(H) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty\ndays, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually\nunder advisement by the court.\u201d\n   8 See Defendant\u2019s Request for Additional Time To File Pre-trial Mo\n\ntions in No. 4:06CR518\u2013SNL (TCM) (ED Mo.), Doc. 19; Order in No.\n4:06CR518\u2013SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44 (granting same).\n\f8                    BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntext governs the automatic excludability of delays \u201cresult\ning\u201d from a specific category of \u201cproceedings concerning\nthe defendant,\u201d namely, proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions.9 Because the delay at issue here results from a\ndecision granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not\nfrom a pretrial motion itself (the defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D). But\nthat does not make the delay at issue here automatically\nexcludable.\n  Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion\nrelated delay to automatic exclusion. Instead, it renders\nautomatically excludable only the delay that occurs \u201cfrom\nthe filing of the motion through the conclusion of the\nhearing on, or other prompt disposition of\u201d the motion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    9 Thedissent argues that this conclusion lacks \u201cforce\u201d because \u201c[i]t is\nat least doubtful . . . that the delay at issue in the present case is delay\n\u2018resulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\nAccording to the dissent, \u201cdelay \u2018resulting from\u2019 a pretrial motion is\ndelay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,\u201d which the \u201ctype of\ndelay involved in the present case\u201d does not.\u201d Post, at 4\u20135 (arguing that\nthe delay in this case instead \u201coccurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time\u201d).\n   The dissent\u2019s position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two\nisolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context.\nFor the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h)\nsupport our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic\nexcludability of delays \u201cresulting from\u201d proceedings involving pretrial\nmotions. As the dissent concedes, defining \u201cresulting from\u201d to mean \u201cas\na consequence of\u201d does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because\nthe dissent\u2019s definition of \u201cresulting from\u201d leaves ample room to con\nclude that the delay at issue here is \u201ca consequence of\u201d the category of\nproceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay\n\u201cas a consequence of\u201d a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or \u201cas a\nconsequence of\u201d a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for addi\ntional time). At bottom, the dissent\u2019s position is not that our interpre\ntation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent\u2019s interpretation is\npreferable. We disagree because the dissent\u2019s interpretation, among\nother things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsec\ntion (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(Emphasis added.) In so doing, the provision communi\ncates Congress\u2019 judgment that delay resulting from pre\ntrial motions is automatically excludable, i.e., excludable\nwithout district court findings, only from the time a mo\ntion is filed through the hearing or disposition point speci\nfied in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pre\ntrial motion-related delay are excludable only when\naccompanied by district court findings.10\n   This limitation is significant because Congress knew\nhow to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion\nbroadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinaf\nter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the auto\nmatic exclusion of \u201cdelay resulting from any proceeding,\nincluding any examinations, to determine the mental\ncompetency or physical capacity of the defendant.\u201d (Em\nphasis added.) With the word \u201cincluding,\u201d Congress indi\ncated that other competency-related proceedings besides\n\u201cexaminations\u201d might fall within subparagraph (A)\u2019s\nautomatic exclusion. In subparagraph (D), by contrast,\nCongress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term\nsuch as \u201cincluding,\u201d and provided instead that only pre\ntrial motion-related delay \u201cfrom the filing\u201d of a motion to\nthe hearing or disposition point specified in the provision\nis automatically excludable from the Act\u2019s 70-day limit.\n   Thus, although the period of delay the Government\nseeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)\u2019s text, but\n\nalso from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the\n70-day period \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d In this case, the comma after the first\nphrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of exclud\nable delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)\u2019s automatic\nexclusion for delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion is limited to delay\nthat occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identi\nfied in the provision.\n\f10                  BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngoverned by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the\nfirst day upon which Congress specified that such delay\nmay be automatically excluded. The result is that the\npretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is\nnot automatically excludable.11\n                             B\n  The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into auto\nmatic excludability because \u201c[a] specific provision\u201d (here,\nsubparagraph (D)) \u201ccontrols one[s] of more general appli\ncation\u201d (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991). In arguing\nthat this principle applies, but requires a result different\nfrom the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government\nand several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in\na manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.\n                              1\n  There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more\nspecific than the \u201cgeneral\u201d language in subsection (h)(1),\npost, at 2, 6, or that \u201c[g]eneral language of a statutory\nprovision, although broad enough to include it, will not be\nheld to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another\npart of the same enactment,\u201d D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v.\nPopkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932). We part company with\nthe dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D)\ngoverns the period of delay at issue in this case. The\ndissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground\nthat it is foreclosed by the statute. See post, at 5 (assert\ning that the delay at issue in this case is \u201cnot necessarily\u201d\ncovered by subparagraph (D)). Instead, it joins the Gov\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he\n\nrequests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis. Even if he files\nsuch a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period\nof automatically excludable delay pre-filing preparation time that\nsubparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

This argument takes aim at an exagger\nated target. Because we conclude that the type of delay at\nissue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can\nin future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries,\na result that is not certain even in this case. See infra, at\n17\u201318. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on\nremand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify read\ning subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to\n\u201cother proceedings concerning the defendant\u201d) to permit\nautomatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any\ndecision to continue a deadline.\n   The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is\nautomatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because\nthe provision\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto\u201d shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclu\nsion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated\nsubparagraphs. See post, at 3; see also United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument\nconfuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s list of\ncategories of excludable delay (each of which is repre\nsented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the catego\nries themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative\nrather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclu\nsion that a delay that falls within the category of delay\naddressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits\nin that subparagraph. The \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d\nclause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to\nmodify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list\nitself. As noted, such a reading would violate settled\nprinciples of statutory construction because it would ig\n\f12                   BLOATE v.

See Gozlon-\nPeretz, supra, at 410; Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167,\n174 (2001) (\u201c[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence,\nor word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)). Our reading avoids these\nproblems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing\neach of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, con\nclusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates other\nwise, see, e.g., \u00a73161(h)(1)(A); supra, at 9, the automatic\nexcludability of the delay resulting from the category of\nproceedings it addresses.\n   The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)\u2019s\nlimits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we\nshould automatically exclude the delay at issue here under\nsubsection (h)(1)\u2019s opening clause, see post, at 2, because it\nis not \u201cclear\u201d that the delay is governed by the more spe\ncific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D).

We decline this invitation to use the alleged uncer\ntainty in subparagraph (D)\u2019s scope as a justification for\ndisregarding its limits and instead expanding, through\nliberal interpretation of subsection (h)(1)\u2019s generic opening\nclause,12 what the dissent itself describes as the automatic\nexclusion \u201cexceptio[n]\u201d to the Act\u2019s 70-day period and the\nAct\u2019s \u201cgeneral rule\u201d requiring \u201cends-of-justice findings for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The dissent argues that the relevant \u201cproceeding\u201d in this case is the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s disposition of petitioner\u2019s motion for additional time to\nfile pretrial motions. See post, at 2. If that were correct, any order\ndisposing of a motion\u2014including a pretrial motion under subparagraph\n(D)\u2014would be a separate \u201cproceeding,\u201d and any resulting delay would\nbe automatically excludable. The dissent\u2019s reading renders superflu\nous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the\nexclusion of time necessary for \u201cadequate preparation for pretrial\nproceedings,\u201d      \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii),  and    \u201ceffective    preparation,\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

The problem with this\nreading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection\n(h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the\ndefinition of a \u201cproceeding concerning the defendant,\u201d and\nthus threatens the Act\u2019s manifest purpose of ensuring\nspeedy trials by construing the Act\u2019s automatic exclusion\nexceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day\nrule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled,\nby the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon\nwhich the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the pros\npect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in\nthis case. Hence our conclusion that the text and struc\nture of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion\nof the delay at issue in this case.\n                               2\n   Our conclusion is further supported by subsection\n(h)(1)\u2019s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7).\nSubsection (h)(7) provides that delays \u201cresulting from a\ncontinuance granted by any judge\u201d may be excluded, but\nonly if the judge finds that \u201cthe ends of justice served by\ntaking such action outweigh the best interest of the public\nand the defendant in a speedy trial\u201d and records those\nfindings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify\na continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice\nrecognized the importance of adequate pretrial prepara\ntion time. See \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court\nto consider whether the \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d nature of a\ncase makes it \u201cunreasonable to expect adequate prepara\ntion for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within\nthe time limits\u201d (emphasis added)); \u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(iv)\n\f14                   BLOATE v.

Our determination that the\ndelay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives\nfull effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions\nfor excluding certain types of delay only where district\ncourt makes findings justifying the exclusion.13 Cf. post,\nat 11\u201312 (construing subsection (h)(1) in a manner that\ncould encompass, and govern, delays expressly within\nsubsection (h)(7)\u2019s purview).\n                              3\n  Finally, our Speedy Trial Act precedents support our\nreading of subsection (h)(1). We recently explained that\nthe Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to\nvindicate the public interest in the swift administration of\njustice. We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of\nthe Act even if he believes it would be in his interest;\n\u201c[a]llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine\nthe Act because there are many cases . . . in which the\nprosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy\nto opt out of the Act, to the detriment of the public inter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Had Congress wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\n\ntime automatically, it could have said so. As noted, subsection (h)(7)\ntwice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances\nthat a court may grant in the interests of justice.                   See\n\u00a7\u00a73161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv). Congress easily could have referred to\npreparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1). See, e.g., Speedy Trial\nAct Amendments Act of 1979, H. R. 3630, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75(c)\n(1979) (proposing to exclude under subparagraph (D) all \u201cdelay result\ning from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses\nand from hearings thereon\u201d (emphasis added)). Congress did not do so,\nand we are bound to enforce only the language that Congress and the\nPresident enacted.\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

S. 489, 502 (2006).14\n   Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to\nexclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time\nhave reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to\nprovide defendants adequate time to build their defense.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Mobile Materials, Inc., 871 F. 2d\n902, 913 (per curiam), opinion supplemented on other\ngrounds on rehearing, 881 F. 2d 866 (CA10 1989) (per\ncuriam). Yet these same courts have recognized that\nreading subsection (h)(1) to exclude all time for preparing\npretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a\nspeedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have\nrecognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or\nboth parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.\nSee Zedner, supra, at 502. To avoid a result so inconsis\ntent with the statute\u2019s purpose\u2014i.e., \u201cto avoid creating a\nbig loophole in the statute,\u201d United States v. Tibboel, 753\nF. 2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)\u2014these courts have found it\nnecessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion\nfor pretrial motion preparation time that their interpreta\ntion of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow. See, e.g.,\nibid. (stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be\nautomatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when\n\u201cthe judge has expressly granted a party time for that\npurpose\u201d (emphasis added)); Oberoi, 547 F. 3d, at 450\n(\u201cThis . . . qualification prevents abuse.

In Henderson v.\nUnited States, 476 U. S. 321, 322 (1986), for example, we carefully\nexamined the text of \u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (now codified as subparagraph (D))\nto determine whether certain periods of pretrial motion-related delay\nwere automatically excludable. Such careful parsing would seem\nunnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not\nconclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the\ncategory of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay\nmay simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).\n\f16               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparty \u2018could delay trial indefinitely merely by working on\npretrial motions right up to the eve of trial\u2019 \u201d).\n  The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude\npreparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on\nexcludability to avoid \u201ccreating a big loophole in the stat\nute,\u201d Tibboel, supra, at 610, underscores the extent to\nwhich their interpretation\u2014and the dissent\u2019s\u2014strays from\nthe Act\u2019s text and purpose. As noted, subsection (h)(7)\nexpressly accounts for the possibility that a district court\nwould need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate\npreparation time. An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is\nnot automatic, however, and requires specific findings.\nAllowing district courts to exclude automatically such\ndelays would redesign this statutory framework.\n                             C\n   We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that\nhave interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically\npretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a\ncontrary reading of that provision would lay \u201ca trap for\ntrial judges\u201d by forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act\nviolation if they wish to grant a defendant\u2019s request for\nadditional time to prepare a pretrial motion, United States\nv. Wilson, 835 F. 2d 1440, 1444 (CADC 1987); see also\nOberoi, supra, at 450.\n   We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to inter\npret the Speedy Trial Act to \u201ctrap\u201d district courts for ac\ncommodating a defendant\u2019s request for additional time to\nprepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this.\nPetitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for\nthe final continuance from February 26 to March 5. And\nthe record clearly shows that the Magistrate Judge and\nthe District Court diligently endeavored to accommodate\npetitioner\u2019s requests\u2014granting his motion for an exten\nsion of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions, his\nmotion for a continuance, and his motion for a new attor\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Fortunately, we can abide by the\nlimitations Congress imposed on the statutory rights at\nissue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that\nwould trap trial courts.\n   For the reasons we explained above, neither subpara\ngraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes\ntime granted to prepare pretrial motions. This conclusion\ndoes not lay a \u201ctrap for trial judges\u201d because it limits (in a\nway the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In\nconsidering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of\ntime will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to\ndevote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay\nare justified, given both the statutory and constitutional\nrequirement of speedy trials. Placing these reasons in the\nrecord does not add an appreciable burden on these\njudges. Neither are district courts forced to choose be\ntween rejecting a defendant\u2019s request for time to prepare\npretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if\npreparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court\nmay exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it\ngrants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded\nfindings \u201cthat the ends of justice served by taking such\naction outweigh the best interest of the public and the\ndefendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Subsection (h)(7) provides\n\u201c[m]uch of the Act\u2019s flexibility,\u201d Zedner, 547 U. S., at 498,\nand gives district courts \u201cdiscretion\u2014within limits and\nsubject to specific procedures\u2014to accommodate limited\ndelays for case-specific needs,\u201d id., at 499. The statutory\nscheme thus ensures that district courts may grant neces\nsary pretrial motion preparation time without risking\ndismissal.\n   Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a\ndistrict court may fail to make the findings necessary for\nan exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall\ngain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act\u2019s\n\f18               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a\nwindfall. A district court may dismiss the charges without\nprejudice, thus allowing the Government to refile charges\nor reindict the defendant. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73162(a)(1). In\nruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district\ncourt should consider, among other factors, the party\nresponsible for the delay. See ibid. (\u201cIn determining\nwhether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the\n[district] court shall consider, among others, each of the\nfollowing factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts\nand circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal;\nand the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of\nthis chapter and on the administration of justice\u201d (empha\nsis added)); see also United States v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326,\n343 (1988) (\u201cSeemingly ignored were the brevity of the\ndelay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respon\ndent, as well as respondent\u2019s own illicit contribution to the\ndelay\u201d).\n                             III\n   Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period\nfrom September 7 through October 4, which includes the\nadditional time granted by the District Court for pretrial\nmotion preparation, is not automatically excludable under\nsubsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address\nwhether any portion of that time might have been other\nwise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its\nmerits brief that another provision of the Act could sup\nport exclusion, presenting the argument that September\n25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in\nits brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argu\nment. We therefore do not consider whether any other\nexclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period.\nInstead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion on the understanding that nothing in the opinion\nbars the Eighth Circuit from considering, on remand, the\nGovernment\u2019s argument that the indictment, and convic\ntions under it, remain effective.\n   Bloate moved, on September 7, 2006, to extend the\ndeadline for filing pretrial motions. The Magistrate Judge\ngranted Bloate\u2019s request that same day, extending the\ndeadline from September 13 to September 25. Having\ngained more time, Bloate decided that pretrial motions\nwere unnecessary after all. Accordingly, on September 25,\nhe filed a proposed waiver of his right to file such motions.\nOn October 4, the Magistrate Judge accepted the waiver\nfollowing a hearing at which the judge found the waiver\nknowing and voluntary. As urged by the Government,\neven if the clock continued to run from September 7,\n    \u201cit stopped on September 25, when [Bloate] filed a\n    pleading advising the court that he had decided not to\n    raise any issues by pretrial motion. . . .

See 18\nU. S. C. A. \u00a73161 (2000 ed. and Supp. 2009).

Subpara\ngraph (D) sets out one of the eight categories of delay that\nare specifically identified as \u201cdelay resulting from [a]\nproceedin[g] concerning the defendant,\u201d but as noted, this\nlist is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited\nto.\u201d \u201cWhen \u2018include\u2019 is utilized, it is generally improper to\nconclude that entities not specifically enumerated are\nexcluded.\u201d 2A N.

S. 95, 100 (1941); Black\u2019s\nLaw 831 (\u201cThe participle including typically indicates a\npartial list\u201d). And the inclusion in subsection (h)(1) of the\nadditional phrase \u201cnot limited to\u201d reinforces this point.\nSee United States v. Tibboel, 753 F. 2d 608, 610 (CA7\n1985).\n   Because subparagraph (D) follows the phrase \u201cincluding\nbut not limited to,\u201d the Court has a steep hurdle to clear to\nshow that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the\ngeneral rule set out in subsection (h)(1). The Court\u2019s\nargument is that subparagraph (D) governs not just \u201cdelay\nresulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D), but\nalso delay resulting from \u201cproceedings involving pretrial\nmotions,\u201d ante, at 8, and n. 9 (emphasis added), and \u201call\npretrial motion-related delay,\u201d ante, at 8 (emphasis added).\nIn the Court\u2019s view, Congress has expressed a judgment\nthat if a period of \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d does not\nfall within the express terms of subparagraph (D), then it\nis \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district court\n\f4                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfindings.\u201d Ante, at 9. Thus, since subparagraph (D) does\nnot provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the\ngranting of a defense request for more time to prepare\npretrial motions, the Court holds that such delay is not\nexcluded from the 70-day calculation. The Court\u2019s analy\nsis, however, is not supported by either the text of sub\nparagraph (D) or the circumstances that gave rise to its\nenactment.\n                              D\n   The Court\u2019s argument would have some force if it were\nclear that the delay involved in the present case is \u201cdelay\nresulting from [a] pretrial motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). It\ncould then be argued that subparagraph (D) reflects a\nlegislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion\nof delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay\noccurs during the period \u201cfrom the filing of the motion\nthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d Ibid.2\n   It is at least doubtful, however, that the delay at issue\nin the present case is delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\nmotion.\u201d Ibid.3 The phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d means \u201cpro\nceed[ing], spring[ing], or aris[ing] as a consequence, effect,\nor conclusion.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\ntionary 1937 (1971). Thus, delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pre\ntrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 TheCourt hints that the defense\u2019s request for additional time might\nitself be a pretrial motion within the meaning of \u00a73161(h)(1)(D).\nNeither party relies on this theory. The Court of Appeals found that\n\u201cBloate never filed a pretrial motion.\u201d 534 F. 3d, at 897.\n   3 This much is clear from the Court\u2019s own language. The Court writes\n\nthat \u201calthough the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in\nthis case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that\nperiod precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such\ndelay may be automatically excluded.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310 (emphasis added).\nSubparagraph (D) does not speak of delay that results from a \u201cproceed\ning,\u201d ibid.; subsection (h)(1), however, does.

The type of delay involved in the present case,\nhowever, does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial\nmotion; rather, it occurs as a consequence of the court\u2019s\ngranting of a defense request for an extension of time.\nThe particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this\npoint because petitioner never filed pretrial motions.4\n   It is telling that the Court elides the statutory phrase\n\u201cresulting from\u201d and substitutes a broader phrase of its\nown invention. The Court writes that \u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d that is not captured by subparagraph (D)\u2019s\ntext is \u201cexcludable only when accompanied by district\ncourt findings.\u201d Ante, at 9. See also ante, at 8 (\u201cSubpara\ngraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay\nto automatic exclusion\u201d); ante, at 9 (\u201c[O]nly pretrial mo\ntion-related delay \u2018from the filing\u2019 of a motion to the hear\ning or disposition point specified in the provision is auto\nmatically excludable\u201d); ante, at 15, n. 14 (\u201cpretrial motion\nrelated delay\u201d); ibid. (\u201cpretrial motion-related proceed\nings\u201d). But \u201cpretrial motion-related delay\u201d is not necessar\nily delay \u201cresulting from\u201d a pretrial motion.\n   Even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase \u201cre\nsulting from\u201d to mean \u201crelated [to],\u201d see ante, at 9, there\nare at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.\nFirst, because subparagraphs (A)\u2013(H) are meant to be\nillustrative, those provisions should not be interpreted as\nlimiting unless the limitation is very clear. Second, the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of subparagraph (D) leads to an\nanomalous result that Congress is unlikely to have in\ntended. Because subparagraph (D) automatically excludes\n\u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing\nof the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of, such motion,\u201d it is clear that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 But even if petitioner had filed pretrial motions, the delay resulting\n\nfrom the granting of the extension still would not be delay \u201cresulting\nfrom\u201d the motion.\n\f6               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsubparagraph (D) automatically excludes delay resulting\nfrom the granting of a prosecution request for additional\ntime to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial motions. The\nCourt has not identified any reason why Congress might\nhave wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay\nresulting from the granting of a prosecution request for\nadditional time to respond to a defendant\u2019s pretrial mo\ntions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the\ndefendant\u2019s request for additional time to prepare those\nvery motions. Since there is nothing to suggest that Con\ngress intended such a strange, asymmetrical result, the\nCourt\u2019s strained interpretation of subparagraph (D) should\nbe rejected. Subparagraph (D) should be read to apply\nonly to delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial motion,\u201d and\nbecause the delay involved here does not result from a\npretrial motion, there is no basis for inferring that sub\nparagraph (D) was meant to take that delay outside the\nscope of the general language of subsection (h)(1).\n                             E\n  The circumstances surrounding the adoption of the\ncurrent version of subparagraph (D) in 1979 point to the\nsame conclusion. That language was adopted to expand\nthe reach of the exclusion. As originally enacted, the\nrelevant provision of the Act excluded only \u201cdelay result\ning from hearings on pretrial motions,\u201d 88 Stat. 2078, and\ncourts had interpreted this language literally to exclude\nonly time actually devoted to hearings. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Lewis, 425 F. Supp. 1166, 1171 (Conn. 1977);\nUnited States v. Conroy, No. 77 Cr. 607 (CHT), 1978 U. S.\nDist.

S. Rep. No. 96\u2013\n212, p. 18 (1979) (hereinafter S. Rep.). See also id., at 26.\nCongress\u2019 expansion of the exclusion set out in subpara\ngraph (D) so that it covers, not just the time taken up by\nhearings on pretrial motions, but all delay resulting from\npretrial motions does not support the inference that Con\ngress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to\ncount against the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day period.\n   Contending that Congress could have been more explicit\nif it \u201cwished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation\ntime automatically,\u201d the Court cites as an example a\nlegislative proposal by the Department of Justice to pro\nvide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pre\ntrial motions. Ante, at 14, n. 13. The Court is correct that\nCongress did not choose this option, but the Court\u2019s argu\nment misses the point.\n   First, it bears emphasizing that the Justice Depart\nment\u2019s proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a\nsuccessful defense request for additional time to prepare\npretrial motions. That is the delay in dispute here. In\nstead, the Justice Department\u2019s proposal excluded all\n\u201cdelay resulting from the preparation and service of pre\ntrial motions and responses from hearings thereon.\u201d S.\n961, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a75 (1979) (as introduced).\n   Second, the reasons given in the Senate Judiciary Com\nmittee report for rejecting the Justice Department pro\nposal do not apply when the delay results from the grant\ning of a defense request such as the one at issue here. The\nSenate Committee report noted that, when excluding time\nfor the preparation of pretrial motions, it will be \u201cquite\ndifficult to determine a point at which preparation actu\nally begins.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. But when a district court\ngrants a defendant\u2019s motion for time to prepare pretrial\n\f8                   BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmotions, that concern is not present. See United States v.\nOberoi, 547 F. 3d 436, 451 (CA2 2008) (noting the impor\ntance of the District Court\u2019s expressly stopping the speedy\ntrial clock to create a point from which to measure prepa\nration time).5 In addition, the Committee expressed the\nview that \u201cin routine cases, preparation time should not be\nexcluded.\u201d S. Rep., at 34. However, cases in which a\ndistrict court accedes to a defense request for more than\nthe usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial\nmotions are by definition not routine.\n   Third, there is no reason why Congress should have\nsupposed that the language that Congress and the Presi\ndent enacted did not reach delay resulting from the grant\ning of the defendant\u2019s request for additional time to pre\npare pretrial motions. As explained above, supra, at 2, 4\u2013\n6, such delay results from a proceeding concerning\nthe defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial\nmotion.\n   In sum, (1) delay resulting from the granting of a de\nfense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial mo\ntions falls within the general rule, set out in subsection\n(h)(1), that automatically excludes delay \u201cresulting from\n[a] proceedin[g] concerning the defendant;\u201d (2) the sub\nparagraphs that follow, which are preceded by the phrase\n\u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d are illustrative, not exhaus\ntive; and (3) neither the text of subparagraph (D) nor the\ncircumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The Court incorrectly states that the Courts of Appeals that have\n\nread subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time for pretrial motions\nhave found it necessary to \u201cimpos[e] extratextual limitations on exclud\nability,\u201d namely, that the trial judge must expressly grant an extension\nof the time for the completion of pretrial motions. See ante, at 16. This\nrequirement, however, springs from the language of subsection (h)(1),\nfor it is the granting of the extension request that constitutes the\n\u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defendant\u201d that triggers the exclusion\nunder subsection (h)(1).

For these reasons, I would hold that the\ndelay in question here is automatically excluded.\n                              II\n  The Court advances several additional arguments in\nsupport of its analysis, but none is persuasive.\n                               A\n  Two of these arguments hinge on the Court\u2019s unjustifia\nbly broad interpretation of subparagraph (D), i.e., that it\ncovers all \u201cpretrial motion-related delay.\u201d First, the Court\nreasons that under a contrary interpretation, \u201ca court\ncould extend by weeks or months, without any finding that\nthe incursion on the Act\u2019s timeliness guarantee is justified,\nthe entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the\nAct sets a default limit of 70 days.\u201d Ante, at 13. But the\nsame is true of the Court\u2019s interpretation. Even under an\ninterpretation that automatically excludes delay \u201conly\nfrom the time a motion is filed through the hearing or\ndisposition point,\u201d ante, at 9, there appears to be no reason\nwhy a district court may not, in its discretion, extend the\nautomatically excludable period of time under subpara\ngraph (D) through any number of means, including: (1)\nextending the time to file an opposition brief, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 4; (2) extending the time to file a reply brief, see\nUnited States v.

Indeed, in\nHenderson we held that 295 days of delay resulting from\nthe filing of a pretrial motion were automatically exclud\nable, and we noted that \u201cCongress was aware of the\nbreadth of the exclusion it was enacting.\u201d Id., at 327.6\nThe Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation is necessary\nto protect the Act\u2019s \u201ctimeliness guarantee,\u201d ante, at 13, is\nillusory.\n   For a similar reason, the Court\u2019s interpretation is not\nsupported by the rule of construction that \u201c \u2018[a] specific\nprovision\u2019 . . . \u2018controls one[s] of more general application.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 10.

Here, there is no conflict be\ncause, even if subparagraph (D) governs \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom any pretrial motion,\u201d there is no basis for concluding\nthat subparagraph (D) governs all \u201cpretrial motion-related\ndelay.\u201d\n                              B\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s claim, its decision is not sup\nported by \u00a73161(h)(7)(A), which excludes \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom a continuance\u201d provided that the trial court \u201csets\nforth, in the record of the case, . . . its reasons for finding\nthat the ends of justice served by the granting of such\ncontinuance outweigh the best interests of the public and\nthe defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d One might argue that a\ntrial judge grants a \u201ccontinuance\u201d whenever the judge\npostpones a trial date, even when the postponement is the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 That the delay in Henderson was delay \u201cresulting from [a] pretrial\n\nmotion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D); see 476 U.

See \u00a73161(h)(7)(A) (\u201c[a]ny\nperiod of delay resulting from a continuance\u201d). But such a\nreading would render subsection (h)(1) and subparagraphs\n(A)\u2013(H) meaningless if it were true that all continuances\nrequired ends-of-justice findings. The plain terms of\nsubsection (h)(1) refute this interpretation and show that\nCongress intended for some periods of delay that postpone\nthe trial date to be automatically excludable.\n   Viewed in their proper context, subsection (h)(1) and its\nsubparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) requiring ends-of-justice findings for con\ntinuances. See, e.g., United States v. Aviles-Alvarez, 868\nF. 2d 1108, 1112 (CA9 1989) (noting that when pretrial\nmotion delay is automatically excluded, the District Court\n\u201cdoes not have to make findings or consider any factors\u201d).\nA period of delay resulting from a continuance requires\nends-of-justice findings only when it does not also fall\nwithin the subset of automatically excludable delay de\nfined by subsection (h)(1). When a period of delay result\ning from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclu\nsion, a court ordinarily should give effect to the more\nspecific provisions of subsection (h)(1). See Gozlon-Peretz\nv. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (\u201cA specific\nprovision controls over one of more general application\u201d).\nCf. ante, at 10.\n   For the reasons discussed, see supra, at 2, the granting\nof a defense request for an extension of time to complete\npretrial motions is a \u201cproceedin[g] concerning the defen\ndant\u201d within the meaning of subsection (h)(1). It may also\nqualify as a \u201ccontinuance\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a73161(h)(7)(A) if the delay has the effect of pushing back\nthe trial date. But a court should resolve the conflict by\napplying the more specific provision of subsection (h)(1).\nThis result is faithful not only to the plain language of the\n\f12               BLOATE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nstatute, but to its overall structure of providing a class of\nexceptions to the general rule that continuances require\nends-of-justice findings. And it also recognizes that when\ndefense counsel argues that adequate pretrial motions\ncannot be completed within the time allotted and is\ngranted an extension, it will generally go without saying\nthat the judge has considered whether the ends of justice\nwill be served by the extension, and requiring the judge to\nrecite this determination on the record will often be an\nempty exercise.\n                              III\n   The Court does not believe that its interpretation will\nhave serious adverse consequences because trial judges, by\nmaking the on-the-record findings required under\n\u00a73161(h)(7), may exclude delay resulting from the grant\ning of a defense request for an extension to file pretrial\nmotions. As this case illustrates, however, there will be\ncases in which busy district judges and magistrate judges\nwill fail to make those findings, and indictments will be\ndismissed for no good reason. If requiring findings on the\nrecord were cost- and risk-free, Congress would not have\nprovided for the automatic exclusion of the broad category\nof delay encompassed by \u00a73161(h)(1).\n   The Court notes that, when a Speedy Trial Act violation\noccurs because of delay caused by an extension requested\nby the defense, a district court may dismiss the indictment\nwithout prejudice.

Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nThe Copyright Act (Act) generally requires copyright holders to register\n  their works before suing for copyright infringement. 17 U. S. C. A.\n  \u00a7411(a). The complaint in this consolidated, class-action copyright in\n  fringement suit alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least\n  one copyright, typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper\n  or magazine, that they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a).\n  The class, however, included both authors who had registered their\n  works and authors who had not. The parties moved the District\n  Court to certify a settlement class and approve a settlement agree\n  ment. The District Court did so over the objections of some freelance\n  authors. On appeal, the Second Circuit sua sponte raised the ques\n  tion whether \u00a7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter juris\n  diction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights,\n  concluding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to certify the\n  class or approve the settlement.\nHeld: Section 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is a precondition to fil\n ing a copyright infringement claim. A copyright holder\u2019s failure to\n comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court\u2019s sub\n ject-matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregis\n tered works. Pp. 5\u201316.\n    (a) \u201cJurisdiction\u201d refers to \u201ca court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u201d Kon\n trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455. Thus, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d properly ap\n plies only to \u201cprescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject\n matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction)\u201d implicat\n ing that authority. Ibid. Because the distinction between jurisdic\n tional conditions and claim-processing rules can be confusing in prac\n tice, federal courts and litigants should use the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d\n only when it is apposite. Ibid. A statutory requirement is considered\n\f2                 REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jurisdictional if Congress \u201cclearly states that [it] count[s] as jurisdic\n    tional\u201d; a condition \u201cnot rank[ed]\u201d as such should be treated \u201cas non\n    jurisdictional in character.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n    515\u2013516. In Arbaugh, the Court held that the employee-numerosity\n    coverage requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was\n    not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not\n    \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,\n    this Court\u2019s prior Title VII cases did not compel the conclusion that\n    the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional, and the requirement\u2019s loca\n    tion in a provision separate from Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction-granting sec\n    tion indicated that Congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdic\n    tional. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Like the Title VII numerosity requirement in Arbaugh, \u00a7411(a)\n    does not \u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that its registration requirement is \u201cjurisdic\n    tional.\u201d 546 U. S., at 515. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s last sentence contains\n    the word \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d that sentence speaks to a court\u2019s adjudicatory\n    authority to determine a copyright claim\u2019s registrability and says\n    nothing about whether a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n    to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works. More\n    over, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title VII\u2019s employee\n    numerosity requirement, is located in a provision \u201cseparate\u201d from\n    those granting federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over those\n    respective claims, ibid., and no other factor suggests that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\n    registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak in jurisdictional\n    terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\u2019 \u201d\n    ibid. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that the employee\n    numerosity requirement in Arbaugh was considered an element of a\n    Title VII claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit. See\n    Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (c) A contrary result is not required by Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n    205. There, in finding that Congress had ranked as jurisdictional 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72107\u2019s requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice\n    of appeal within 30 days of the judgment, this Court analyzed \u00a72107\u2019s\n    specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type\n    of limitation. That analysis is consistent with the Arbaugh frame\n    work because context is relevant to whether a statute \u201crank[s]\u201d a re\n    quirement as jurisdictional. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       (d) The Court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the Sec\n    ond Circuit\u2019s judgment vacating the settlement. While some of peti\n    tioners\u2019 arguments below are in tension with those made in this\n    Court, accepting their arguments here does not create the type of \u201cin\n    consistent court determinations\u201d in their favor that estoppel is meant\n    to address.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\n(Supp. 2009). In this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that a copyright holder\u2019s failure to\ncomply with \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement deprives a\nfederal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright\ninfringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim\nthat does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power \u201c[t]o pro\nmote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing\nfor limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to . . .\ntheir . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.

This\nscheme gives copyright owners \u201cthe exclusive rights\u201d (with\nspecified statutory exceptions) to distribute, reproduce, or\npublicly perform their works. \u00a7106. \u201cAnyone who violates\nany of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as pro\nvided\u201d in the Act \u201cis an infringer of the copyright.\u201d\n\u00a7501(a). When such infringement occurs, a copyright\nowner \u201cis entitled, subject to the requirements of section\n411, to institute an action\u201d for copyright infringement.\n\u00a7501(b) (emphasis added).\n   This case concerns \u201cthe requirements of section 411\u201d to\nwhich \u00a7501(b) refers. Section 411(a) provides, inter alia\nand with certain exceptions, that \u201cno civil action for in\nfringement of the copyright in any United States work\nshall be instituted until preregistration or registration of\nthe copyright claim has been made in accordance with this\ntitle.\u201d1 This provision is part of the Act\u2019s remedial scheme.\nIt establishes a condition\u2014copyright registration\u2014that\nplaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringe\nment claim and invoking the Act\u2019s remedial provisions.\nWe address whether \u00a7411(a) also deprives federal courts of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement\nclaims involving unregistered works.\n                            B\n  The relevant proceedings in this case began after we\nissued our opinion in New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533\nU. S. 483 (2001). In Tasini, we agreed with the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit that several owners of\nonline databases and print publishers had infringed the\ncopyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the\nauthors\u2019 works electronically without first securing their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Other\n          sections of the Act\u2014principally \u00a7\u00a7408\u2013410\u2014detail the regis\ntration process, and establish remedial incentives to encourage copy\nright holders to register their works, see, e.g., \u00a7410(c); 17 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7412 (2005 ed. and Supp. 2009).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermission. See id., at 493. In so holding, we affirmed the\nprincipal theory of liability underlying copyright infringe\nment suits that other freelance authors had filed after the\nCourt of Appeals had issued its opinion in Tasini. These\nother suits, which were stayed pending our decision in\nTasini, resumed after we issued our opinion and were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation.\n   The consolidated complaint alleged that the named\nplaintiffs each own at least one copyright, typically in a\nfreelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,\nthat they had registered in accordance with \u00a7411(a). The\nclass, however, included both authors who had registered\ntheir copyrighted works and authors who had not. See\nApp. 94.\n   Because of the growing size and complexity of the law\nsuit, the District Court referred the parties to mediation.\nFor more than three years, the freelance authors, the\npublishers (and their insurers), and the electronic data\nbases (and their insurers) negotiated. Finally, in March\n2005, they reached a settlement agreement that the par\nties intended \u201cto achieve a global peace in the publishing\nindustry.\u201d In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases\nCopyright Litigation, 509 F. 3d 116, 119 (CA2 2007).\n   The parties moved the District Court to certify a class\nfor settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.\nTen freelance authors, including Irvin Muchnick (herein\nafter Muchnick respondents), objected. The District Court\noverruled the objections; certified a settlement class of\nfreelance authors under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n23(a) and (b)(3); approved the settlement as fair, reason\nable, and adequate under Rule 23(e); and entered final\njudgment. At no time did the Muchnick respondents or\nany other party urge the District Court to dismiss the\ncase, or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settle\n\f4              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Muchnick respondents appealed, renewing their\nobjections to the settlement on procedural and substantive\ngrounds. Shortly before oral argument, the Court of Ap\npeals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether\n\u00a7411(a) deprives federal courts of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion over infringement claims involving unregistered\ncopyrights. All parties filed briefs asserting that the\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve\nthe settlement agreement even though it included unreg\nistered works.\n   Relying on two Circuit precedents holding that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s\nregistration requirement was jurisdictional, see 509 F. 3d,\nat 121 (citing Well-Made Toy Mfg. Corp. v. Goffa Int\u2019l\nCorp., 354 F. 3d 112, 114\u2013115 (CA2 2003); Morris v. Busi\nness Concepts, Inc., 259 F. 3d 65, 72\u201373 (CA2 2001)), the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the District Court lacked\njurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the\ninfringement of unregistered works, and also lacked juris\ndiction to approve a settlement with respect to those\nclaims, 509 F. 3d, at 121 (citing \u201cwidespread agreement\namong the circuits that section 411(a) is jurisdictional\u201d).2\n   Judge Walker dissented.

Section 2000e(b) does not\n\u201cclearly stat[e]\u201d that the employee numerosity threshold\non Title VII\u2019s scope \u201ccount[s] as jurisdictional.\u201d Id., at\n515\u2013516, and n. 11. And nothing in our prior Title VII\ncases compelled the conclusion that even though the nu\nmerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label, it\nnonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit. See id., at\n511\u2013513. Similarly, \u00a72000e(b)\u2019s text and structure did not\ndemonstrate that Congress \u201crank[ed]\u201d that requirement as\njurisdictional. See id., at 513\u2013516. As we observed, the\nemployee numerosity requirement is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(3), Title VII\u2019s jurisdiction\ngranting section, distinguishing it from the \u201camount-in\ncontroversy threshold ingredient of subject-matter juris\ndiction . . . in diversity-of-jurisdiction under 28 U.

It does not. Amicus disagrees, pointing to\nthe presence of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in the last sentence\nof \u00a7411(a) and contending that the use of the term there\nindicates the jurisdictional cast of \u00a7411(a)\u2019s first sentence\nas well. Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in\nsupport of Judgment Below 18 (hereinafter Amicus Brief).\nBut this reference to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d cannot bear the weight\nthat amicus places upon it.

See\nVacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus\nWatch Co., 260 F. 2d 637, 640\u2013641 (CA2 1958) (construing\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s precursor). The 1976 amendment made it clear\nthat a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to\ndetermine \u201cthat issue,\u201d \u00a7411(a) (emphasis added)\u2014i.e., the\nissue of registrability\u2014regardless of whether the Register\nis a party to the infringement suit. The word \u201cjurisdic\ntion,\u201d as used here, thus says nothing about whether a\nfederal court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate\nclaims for infringement of unregistered works.\n   Moreover, \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement, like Title\nVII\u2019s numerosity requirement, is located in a provision\n\u201cseparate\u201d from those granting federal courts subject\nmatter jurisdiction over those respective claims. See\nArbaugh, supra, at 514\u2013515. Federal district courts have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement\nactions based on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331 and 1338. But neither\n\u00a71331, which confers subject-matter jurisdiction over\nquestions of federal law, nor \u00a71338(a), which is specific to\ncopyright claims, conditions its jurisdictional grant on\nwhether copyright holders have registered their works\nbefore suing for infringement. Cf. Arbaugh, supra, at 515\n(\u201cTitle VII\u2019s jurisdictional provision\u201d does not \u201cspecif[y]\nany threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332\u2019s mone\ntary floor\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 See   Act of Mar. 4, 1909, \u00a712, 35 Stat. 1078.\n\f10              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor does any other factor suggest that 17 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement can be read to \u201c \u2018speak\nin jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdic\ntion of the district courts.\u2019 \u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515\n(quoting Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394). First, and most signifi\ncantly, \u00a7411(a) expressly allows courts to adjudicate in\nfringement claims involving unregistered works in three\ncircumstances: where the work is not a U. S. work, where\nthe infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and\nintegrity under \u00a7106A, or where the holder attempted to\nregister the work and registration was refused. Sepa\nrately, \u00a7411(c) permits courts to adjudicate infringement\nactions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the\nauthor \u201cdeclare[s] an intention to secure copyright in the\nwork\u201d and \u201cmakes registration for the work, if required by\nsubsection (a), within three months after [the work\u2019s] first\ntransmission.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7411(c)(1)\u2013(2). It would be at\nleast unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a\ncondition subject to these sorts of exceptions.5\n   That the numerosity requirement in Arbaugh could be\nconsidered an element of a Title VII claim, rather than a\nprerequisite to initiating a lawsuit, does not change this\nconclusion, as our decision in Zipes demonstrates. Zipes\n(upon which Arbaugh relied) held that Title VII\u2019s require\nment that sex-discrimination claimants timely file a dis\ncrimination charge with the EEOC before filing a civil\naction in federal court was nonjurisdictional. See 455\nU. S., at 393; 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(f)(1) (establishing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Cf. Zipes, 455 U.

Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002) (\u201c[J]urisdiction\u201d properly\nrefers to a court\u2019s power to hear a case, a matter that \u201ccan never be\nforfeited or waived\u201d).\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

A statutory condition that requires a party to\ntake some action before filing a lawsuit is not automati\ncally \u201ca jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.\u201d Zipes, 455\nU. S., at 393 (emphasis added). Rather, the jurisdictional\nanalysis must focus on the \u201clegal character\u201d of the re\nquirement, id., at 395, which we discerned by looking to\nthe condition\u2019s text, context, and relevant historical treat\nment, id., at 393\u2013395; see also National Railroad Passen\nger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 119\u2013121 (2002).\nWe similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types\nof threshold requirements that claimants must complete,\nor exhaust, before filing a lawsuit.6\n   The registration requirement in 17 U. S. C. A. \u00a7411(a)\nfits in this mold. Section 411(a) imposes a precondition to\nfiling a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is\nnot located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and ad\nmits of congressionally authorized exceptions.           See\n\u00a7\u00a7411(a)\u2013(c). Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of pre\ncondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment\nunder our precedents.\n                            C\n  Amicus insists that our decision in Bowles, 551 U. S.\n205, compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach\ntoday. Amicus cites Bowles for the proposition that where\nCongress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 211 (2007) (treating the adminis\n\ntrative exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (PLRA)\u2014which states that \u201cno action shall be brought with\nrespect to prison conditions under \u00a71983 of this title, or any other\nFederal law, by a prisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as\nare available are exhausted,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a)\u2014as an affirmative\ndefense even though \u201c[t]here is no question that exhaustion is manda\ntory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought\nin court\u201d); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 93 (2006) (same).\n\f12              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictional, a court nevertheless should treat it as such\nif that is how the condition consistently has been inter\npreted and if Congress has not disturbed that interpreta\ntion. Amicus Brief 26. Specifically, amicus relies on a\nfootnote in Bowles to argue that here, as in Bowles, it\nwould be improper to characterize the statutory condition\nas nonjurisdictional because doing so would override \u201c \u2018a\ncentury\u2019s worth of precedent\u2019 \u201d treating \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion requirement as jurisdictional. Amicus Brief 26 (quot\ning Bowles, supra, at 209, n. 2). This argument focuses\non the result in Bowles, rather than on the analysis we\nemployed.\n   Bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid\nof an express jurisdictional label should be treated as\njurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as\nsuch. Nor did it hold that all statutory conditions impos\ning a time limit should be considered jurisdictional.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Bowles, for example, distinguished Scarborough v. Principi, 541\n\nU. S. 401 (2004), which characterized as nonjurisdictional an express\nstatutory time limit for initiating postjudgment proceedings for attor\nney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. See 551 U. S., at 211.\nAs we explained, the time limit in Scarborough \u201cconcerned \u2018a mode of\nrelief . . . ancillary to the judgment of a court\u2019 that already had plenary\njurisdiction.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211 (quoting Scarborough, supra, at 413;\n(emphasis added)). Bowles also distinguished Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004), and Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per\ncuriam), as cases in which the Court properly held that certain time\nlimits were nonjurisdictional because they were imposed by rules that\ndid not purport to have any jurisdictional significance. See 551 U. S.,\nat 210\u2013211. Kontrick involved \u201ctime constraints applicable to objec\ntions to discharge\u201d in bankruptcy proceedings. 540 U. S., at 453. In\nthat case, we first examined 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(J), the statute\n\u201cconferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge,\u201d and observed that\nit did not contain a timeliness requirement. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 453.\nRather, the \u201ctime constraints applicable to objections to discharge\u201d\nwere contained in the Bankruptcy Rules, which expressly state that\nthey \u201c \u2018shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the\ncourts.\u2019 \u201d See ibid. (quoting Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9030). Eberhart, in\nturn, treated as nonjurisdictional certain rules that the Court held\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRather, Bowles stands for the proposition that context,\nincluding this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions\nin many years past, is relevant to whether a statute ranks\na requirement as jurisdictional.\n   In Bowles, we considered 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107, which re\nquires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal\nwithin 30 days of the judgment being appealed, and Rule 4\nof the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which \u201ccar\nries \u00a72107 into practice.\u201d 551 U. S., at 208. After analyz\ning \u00a72107\u2019s specific language and this Court\u2019s historical\ntreatment of the type of limitation \u00a72107 imposes (i.e.,\nstatutory deadlines for filing appeals), we concluded that\nCongress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdic\ntional. Our focus in Bowles on the historical treatment of\nstatutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consis\ntent with the Arbaugh framework. Indeed, Bowles em\nphasized that this Court had long treated such conditions\nas jurisdictional, including in statutes other than \u00a72107,\nand specifically in statutes that predated the creation of\nthe courts of appeals. See 551 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and n. 2.\n   Bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant ques\ntion here is not (as amicus puts it) whether \u00a7411(a) itself\nhas long been labeled jurisdictional, but whether the type\nof limitation that \u00a7411(a) imposes is one that is properly\nranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.\nThe statutory limitation in Bowles was of a type that we\nhad long held did \u201cspeak in jurisdictional terms\u201d even\nabsent a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d label, and nothing about \u00a72107\u2019s\ntext or context, or the historical treatment of that type of\nlimitation, justified a departure from this view. That was\nnot the case, however, for the types of conditions in Zipes\nand Arbaugh.\n   Here, that same analysis leads us to conclude that\n\u00a7411(a) does not implicate the subject-matter jurisdiction \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u201cclosely parallel[ed]\u201d those in Kontrick. 546 U. S., at 15. \n\n\f14             REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof federal courts. Although \u00a7411(a)\u2019s historical treatment\nas \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a factor in the analysis, it is not\ndispositive. The other factors discussed above demon\nstrate that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is more\nanalogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we consid\nered in Zipes and Arbaugh than to the statutory time limit\nat issue in Bowles.8 We thus conclude that \u00a7411(a)\u2019s regis\ntration requirement is nonjurisdictional, notwithstanding\nits prior jurisdictional treatment.9\n                             III\n   Amicus argues that even if \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional,\nwe should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 judgment vacating the District Court\u2019s\norder approving the settlement and dismissing the case.\nAccording to amicus, petitioners asserted previously in\nthese proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdic\ntional, and this assertion should estop them from now\nasserting a right to waive objections to the authors\u2019 failure\nto register. Amicus urges us to prevent the parties \u201cfrom\n\u2018playing fast and loose with the courts\u2019 by \u2018deliberately\nchanging positions according to the exigencies of the mo\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 This conclusion mirrors our holding in Zipes that Title VII\u2019s EEOC\n\nfiling requirement was nonjurisdictional, even though some of our own\ndecisions had characterized it as jurisdictional. See 455 U. S., at 395\n(noting that \u201cthe legal character of the requirement was not at issue in\nthose\u201d earlier cases); see also National Railroad Passenger Corporation\nv. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 109, 121 (2002) (relying on the analysis in\nZipes).\n   9 Amicus\u2019 remaining jurisdictional argument\u2014that the policy goals\n\nunderlying copyright registration support construing \u00a7411(a)\u2019s registra\ntion provisions as jurisdictional, see Amicus Brief 45\u2014is similarly\nunavailing. We do not agree that a condition should be ranked as\njurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional\nobjectives. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 504, 515\u2013516\n(2006) (holding that Title VII\u2019s numerosity requirement is nonjurisdic\ntional even though it serves the important policy goal of \u201cspar[ing] very\nsmall businesses from Title VII liability\u201d).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 742, 750 (2001)).\n   We agree that some statements in the parties\u2019 submis\nsions to the District Court and the Court of Appeals are in\ntension with their arguments here. But we decline to\napply judicial estoppel. As we explained in New Hamp\nshire, that doctrine typically applies when, among other\nthings, a \u201cparty has succeeded in persuading a court to\naccept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial accep\ntance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding\nwould create the perception that either the first or the\nsecond court was misled.\u201d Id., at 750 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Such circumstances do not exist here for two reasons.\nFirst, the parties made their prior statements when nego\ntiating or defending the settlement agreement. We do not\nfault the parties\u2019 lawyers for invoking in the negotiations\nbinding Circuit precedent that supported their clients\u2019\npositions. Perhaps more importantly, in approving the\nsettlement, the District Court did not adopt petitioners\u2019\ninterpretation of \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional. Second, when\nthe Court of Appeals asked petitioners to brief whether\n\u00a7411(a) restricted the District Court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction, they argued that it did not, and the Court of\nAppeals rejected their arguments. See App. to Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 3a\u20135a, and n. 2. Accepting petitioners\u2019\narguments here thus cannot create \u201cinconsistent court\ndeterminations\u201d in their favor. New Hampshire, supra, at\n751 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore hold\nthat the District Court had authority to adjudicate the\nparties\u2019 request to approve their settlement.\n                            IV\n  Our holding that \u00a7411(a) does not restrict a federal\ncourt\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction precludes the need for\nus to address the parties\u2019 alternative arguments as to\n\f16          REED ELSEVIER, INC. v.

S. C. A. \u00a7411(a) (Supp. 2009). That provision, which\ninstructs authors to register their copyrights before com\nmencing suit for infringement, \u201cis a precondition to filing a\nclaim that does not restrict a federal court\u2019s subject-matter\njurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 1. I further agree that Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500 (2006), is the controlling prece\ndent, see ante, at 6, and that Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S.\n205 (2007), does not counsel otherwise. There is, however,\nundeniable tension between the two decisions. Aiming to\nstave off continuing controversy over what qualifies as\n\u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and what does not, I set out my under\nstanding of the Court\u2019s opinions in Arbaugh and Bowles,\nand the ground on which I would reconcile those rulings.\n   In Arbaugh, we held nonjurisdictional a prescription\nconfining Title VII\u2019s coverage to employers with 15 or\nmore employees, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). After observ\ning that \u201cthe 15-employee threshold . . . \u2018d[id] not speak in\njurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction\nof the district courts,\u2019 \u201d 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982)), the\nArbaugh opinion announced and applied a \u201creadily admin\n\f2              REED ELSEVIER, INC. v. MUCHNICK\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nistrable bright line\u201d:\n     \u201cIf the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limi\n     tation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdic\n     tional, then courts and litigants will be duly in\n     structed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.\n     But when Congress does not rank a statutory limita\n     tion on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat\n     the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character. Ap\n     plying that readily administrable bright line to this\n     case, we hold that the threshold number of employees\n     for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\u2019s\n     claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.\u201d 546 U. S.,\n     at 515\u2013516 (citation and footnote omitted).\nAs the above-quoted passage indicates, the unanimous\nArbaugh Court anticipated that all federal courts would\nthereafter adhere to the \u201cbright line\u201d held dispositive that\nday.\n   Bowles moved in a different direction. A sharply divided\nCourt there held \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d the time\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72107(a), (c). 551 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Bowles mentioned Arbaugh only to distinguish\nit as involving a statute setting \u201can employee-numerosity\nrequirement, not a time limit.\u201d 551 U. S., at 211. Section\n2107\u2019s time limits were \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d Bowles explained,\nbecause they were contained in a statute, not merely a\nrule, id., at 210\u2013213, and because \u201c[t]his Court ha[d] long\nheld that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed\ntime is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d id., at 209. Fidel\nity to Arbaugh and similarly reasoned decisions,* the\ndissent in Bowles observed, would have yielded the conclu\nsion that statutory time limits \u201care only jurisdictional if\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * E.g., Eberhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam);\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401 (2004); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443 (2004).\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 217 (opinion of Souter, J.).\n   Bowles and Arbaugh can be reconciled without distort\ning either decision, however, on the ground that Bowles\n\u201crel[ied] on a long line of this Court\u2019s decisions left undis\nturbed by Congress.\u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive\nEngineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment,\nCentral Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13)\n(citing Bowles, 551 U. S., at 209\u2013211). The same is true of\nour decision, subsequent to Bowles, in John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 (2008). There\nthe Court concluded, largely on stare decisis grounds, that\nthe Court of Federal Claims statute of limitations requires\nsua sponte consideration of a lawsuit\u2019s timeliness. Id., at\n136 (\u201c[P]etitioner can succeed only by convincing us that\nthis Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn,\nits earlier precedent.\u201d).\n   Plainly read, Arbaugh and Bowles both point to the\nconclusion that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional.          Section\n411(a) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in\nany way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d Zipes,\n455 U. S., at 394. Arbaugh\u2019s \u201creadily administrable bright\nline\u201d is therefore controlling. 546 U.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08\u20136925. Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided March 2, 2010\nPetitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a\n  convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). The Government sought sen\n  tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an\n  enhanced penalty for a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas\n  three previous convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1), defined\n  as, inter alia, an offense that \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physi\n  cal force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the\n  three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John\n  son\u2019s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a\n  first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b), but was a felony\n  conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of\n  another battery, Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery\n  occurs when a person either \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touches or\n  strikes another person against [his] will,\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally causes\n  bodily harm to another person.\u201d \u00a7784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record\n  permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson\u2019s 2003 convic\n  tion rested upon the \u201cstrik[ing]\u201d or \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily\n  harm\u201d elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a\n  predicate conviction for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career\n  Criminal Act only if \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]\u201d another\n  constitutes the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con\n  cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson\u2019s sentence un\n  der \u00a7924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Florida felony offense of battery by \u201c[a]ctually and intention\n ally touch[ing]\u201d another person does not have \u201cas an element the use\n . . . of physical force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n and thus does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7924(e)(1).\n\f2                     JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 3\u201312.\n       (a) In interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i),\n    the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in\n    State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218, that, under Florida\u2019s statutory\n    equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7775.084,\n    the offense of battery does not \u201cinvolve the use . . . of physical force or\n    violence against any individual,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7776.08. The meaning of\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not\n    state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme\n    Court\u2019s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ\n    ing the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2019s element\n    of \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touching\u201d another person is satisfied\n    by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (b) Because \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d the\n    Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,\n    516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145. The adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear. The noun\n    \u201cforce,\u201d however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning\n    refers to the application of strength, power, and violence\u2014in this con\n    text, against another person. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (c) The Government suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s defi\n    nition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a legal term of art describing one of the\n    elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that\n    element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al\n    though a common-law term of art should be given its established\n    common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term\n    a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here\n    \u201cphysical force\u201d is used in defining not the crime of battery, but\n    rather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). In\n    that context, \u201cphysical force\u201d means violent force\u2014i.e., force capable\n    of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.\n    Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning\n    the Government seeks to impute to the term \u201cforce\u201d derives from the\n    elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of\n    \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that \u201cforce\u201d in the definition of a \u201cviolent fel\n    ony\u201d should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define\n    the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference\n    about the amount of \u201cforce\u201d required by \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn\n    from \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (d) There is no force to the Government\u2019s prediction that this deci\n    sion will undermine its ability to enforce \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm disabil\n    ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of\n    domestic violence that has as an element the \u201cuse . . . of physical\n    force,\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase \u201cphysical\n    force\u201d only in the context of a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Similarly misplaced is\n  the Government\u2019s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob\n  tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge\n  neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un\n  wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a\n  nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an\n  alien convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,\n  ___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli\n  ance upon the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the definition of \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that \u201cinvolves\n  conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n  another.\u201d Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera\n  tion whether Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent\n  felony\u201d under that provision.

Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \u201chas as an element\nthe use . . . of physical force against the person of an\nother,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n\u00a7924(e)(1).\n                             I\n  Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing\nammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1).      The Government\nsought an enhanced penalty under \u00a7924(e), which provides\nthat a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who \u201chas three\nprevious convictions\u201d for \u201ca violent felony\u201d \u201ccommitted on\noccasions different from one another\u201d shall be imprisoned\nfor a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that:\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n\f2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   Johnson\u2019s indictment specified five prior felony convic\ntions. The Government contended that three of those\nconvictions\u2014for aggravated battery and for burglary of a\ndwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003\u2014\nrendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under \u00a7924(e)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that\nthe two 1986 convictions were for \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d but\nhe objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That\nconviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which\nordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant\nwho (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even\nsimple battery) before, \u00a7784.03(2).\n   Under \u00a7784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person\neither \u201c1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes\nanother person against the will of the other,\u201d or\n\u201c2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d\nBecause the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the\nprosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.\nState v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can\nprove that the defendant \u201c[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily\nharm,\u201d that he \u201cintentionally str[uck]\u201d the victim, or that\nhe merely \u201c[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]\u201d the\nvictim.\n   Since nothing in the record of Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery\nconviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it\nrested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural\nity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act only\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The District Court concluded that it\ndoes, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under \u00a7924(e)(1)\nto a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences\nupon \u201cviolent career criminal[s],\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7775.084(4)(d)\n(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic\ntions for certain felonies, including any \u201cforcible felony,\u201d\n\u00a7775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). \u201c[F]orcible felony\u201d is defined to in\nclude a list of enumerated felonies\u2014including murder,\nmanslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated\nassault, and aggravated battery\u2014and also \u201cany other\nfelony which involves the use or threat of physical force or\nviolence against any individual.\u201d \u00a7776.08. In Hearns, the\nFlorida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of\nbattery on a law enforcement officer, \u00a7784.07(2)(b)\u2014which\nrequires the same conduct (directed against a law en\nforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under\n\u00a7784.03(1)(a)\u2014was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at\n219. It said that since \u00a7784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only\nthe slightest unwanted physical touch, \u201cthe use . . . of\nphysical force\u201d was not an element of the offense. Id., at\n219.\n   Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted\nphysical touching constitutes \u201cphysical force\u201d under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s conclusion in Hearns that it does not\nconstitute \u201cphysical force.\u201d That is not so. The meaning of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal\nlaw, not state law. And in answering that question we are\n\f4               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of a similar\u2014or\neven identical\u2014state statute.\n   We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ninterpretation of state law, including its determination of\nthe elements of Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2). See Johnson v.\nFankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme\nCourt has held that the element of \u201cactually and inten\ntionally touching\u201d under Florida\u2019s battery law is satisfied\nby any intentional physical contact, \u201cno matter how\nslight.\u201d Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most \u201cnominal\ncontact,\u201d such as a \u201cta[p] . . . on the shoulder without\nconsent,\u201d id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply\n\u201cth[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,\u201d\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in\ndetermining whether a felony conviction for battery under\nFla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(2) meets the definition of \u201cviolent fel\nony\u201d in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n                              III\n   Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define \u201cphysical force,\u201d\nand we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.\nBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144\u2013145 (1995).\nThe adjective \u201cphysical\u201d is clear in meaning but not of\nmuch help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted\nby and through concrete bodies\u2014distinguishing physical\nforce from, for example, intellectual force or emotional\nforce. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; \u201cforce\u201d has a\nnumber of meanings. For present purposes we can ex\nclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a\ncause of the acceleration of mass. Webster\u2019s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s\nSecond). In more general usage it means \u201c[s]trength or\nenergy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of\nstrength or energy,\u201d \u201c[p]ower to affect strongly in physical\nrelations,\u201d or \u201c[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint\nexerted upon a person.\u201d Id., at 985. Black\u2019s Law Diction\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black\u2019s) defines \u201cforce\u201d\nas \u201c[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person\nor thing.\u201d And it defines \u201cphysical force\u201d as \u201c[f]orce con\nsisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against\na robbery victim.\u201d Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a\ndegree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest\ntouching.\n   There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the\nword \u201cforce\u201d: its use in describing one of the elements of\nthe common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the\nintentional application of unlawful force against the per\nson of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive\nCriminal Law \u00a77.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);\naccord, Black\u2019s 173. The common law held this element of\n\u201cforce\u201d to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch\ning. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.\nCommonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428\n(1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a77.15(a). The\nquestion is whether the term \u201cforce\u201d in 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in\nthe common-law definition of battery. The Government\nasserts that it does. We disagree.\n   Although a common-law term of art should be given its\nestablished common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,\n352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu\ntory word is used as a term of art where that meaning\ndoes not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),\nand we \u201cdo not force term-of-art definitions into contexts\nwhere they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,\u201d\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d as used in defining not the crime of battery, but\nrather the statutory category of \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we\n\f6               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpreted the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nin 18 U. S. C. \u00a716. That provision is very similar to\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense\nwhich \u201chas as an element the use . . . of physical force\nagainst the person or property of another,\u201d \u00a716(a). We\nstated:\n      \u201cIn construing both parts of \u00a716, we cannot forget\n    that we ultimately are determining the meaning of\n    the term \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 The ordinary meaning of\n    this term, combined with \u00a716\u2019s emphasis on the use of\n    physical force against another person (or the risk of\n    having to use such force in committing a crime), sug\n    gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .\u201d 543\n    U. S., at 11.\n  Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a\nstatutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the phrase \u201cphysi\ncal force\u201d means violent force\u2014that is, force capable of\ncausing physical pain or injury to another person. See\nFlores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter\nbrook, J.).     Even by itself, the word \u201cviolent\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web\nster\u2019s Second 2846 (defining \u201cviolent\u201d as \u201c[m]oving, acting,\nor characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and\nsudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;\nvehement . . .\u201d); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.\n1989) (\u201c[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical\nforce or strength\u201d); Black\u2019s 1706 (\u201c[o]f, relating to, or char\nacterized by strong physical force\u201d). When the adjective\n\u201cviolent\u201d is attached to the noun \u201cfelony,\u201d its connotation\nof strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188\n(defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201c[a] crime characterized by\nextreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon\u201d); see also\nUnited States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)\n(Breyer, C. J.) (\u201c[T]he term to be defined, \u2018violent felony,\u2019\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the\npossibility of more closely related, active violence\u201d).\n    It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d the Government would seek to import into this\ndefinition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a meaning derived from a\ncommon-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery\u2014all\nbattery, and not merely battery by the merest touching\u2014\nwas a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216\u2013\n218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, \u00a72.1(b), at\n90; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175\n(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5\u20136 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and\nfelonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple\nbattery\u2014whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury\nvariety\u2014generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,\ne.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a716.1(b) (2d\ned. 2003 and Supp. 2009\u20132010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(b); Ill.\nComp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/12\u20133(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a722.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that\nCongress would select as a term of art defining \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean\ning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course\n\u201cphysical force\u201d can be given its common-law misdemeanor\nmeaning by artful language, but here the only text that\ncan be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase \u201cphysical\nforce\u201d itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The dissent notes, post, at 5\u20136, that, around the time the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act became law, in \u201cquite a few States\u201d it was a felony\noffense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,\nsuch as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether\na conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a \u201cfelony\u201d conviction. But it has no\nbearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses\u2014\nmaking unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of\nindividuals\u2014involves the use of \u201cforce\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.\n\f8                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent\nforce, there is no reason to define \u201cviolent felony\u201d by refer\nence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.\n   The Government argues that we cannot construe 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as\nan element the use of violent force, because there is no\nmodifier in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of\n\u201cphysical force\u201d required. As we have discussed, however,\nthe term \u201cphysical force\u201d itself normally connotes force\nstrong enough to constitute \u201cpower\u201d\u2014and all the more so\nwhen it is contained in a definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Nor\nis there any merit to the dissent\u2019s contention, post, at 4,\nthat the term \u201cforce\u201d in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to\nrequire violent force, because Congress specifically named\n\u201cburglary\u201d and \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can\nbe committed without violence. The point would have\nforce (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have \u201cas an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d\nIn fact, however, they are listed in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as\nexamples of felonies that \u201cpresen[t] a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.\u201d The Government has not\nargued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies\nunder this latter provision. What the dissent\u2019s argument\ncomes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies\nthat create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as\nviolent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that\ninvolve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of\nphysical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub\nparagraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Even further afield is the dissent\u2019s argument, post, at 2\u20133, that since\n\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather\nlike saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe\noranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer\nence from the presence of the \u201cbodily injury\u201d specification\nadded to the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).\nThat provision forbids the possession of firearms by a\nperson subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the\n\u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona\nbly be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d Ibid. The absence\nof such language in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government\ncontends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a\nmatter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that\n\u201cphysical force\u201d must rise to the level of bodily injury does\nnot suggest that without the qualification \u201cphysical force\u201d\nwould consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for\nexample, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict\npain\u2014a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is\nnot a case where Congress has \u201cinclude[d] particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in\nanother section of the same Act,\u201d Russello v. United States,\n464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;\nemphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into\nlaw in 1994\u2014eight years after enactment of the language\nin \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103\u2013322, \u00a7110401,\n108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99\u2013570, \u00a71402, 100\nStat. 3207\u201339 (1986).\n                              IV\n  The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its\nability to enforce the firearm disability in \u00a7922(g)(9) for\npersons who previously have been convicted of a \u201cmisde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d which is defined to\ninclude certain misdemeanor offenses that have, \u201cas an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,\u201d\n\u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have\ninterpreted the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d only in the context\n\f10              JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof a statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d We do not\ndecide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con\ntext of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\nThe issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.\n   In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our\ninterpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur\nsuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a\n\u201ccrime of domestic violence.\u201d That phrase is defined to\nmean \u201cany crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.\n\u00a716])\u201d committed by certain persons, including spouses,\nformer spouses, and parents. \u00a71227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov\nernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal\nbased upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,\ndo not require the use of violent physical force. The dis\nsent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi\nfied, post, at 6\u20137, and n. 3, as having generic felony\nbattery statutes that cover both violent force and un\nwanted physical contact, our decision will render convic\ntions under those statutes \u201coutside the scope of [the\nArmed Career Criminal Act],\u201d post, at 8.\n   This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.\nWhen the law under which the defendant has been con\nvicted contains statutory phrases that cover several differ\nent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and\nsome of which do not, the \u201c \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019 \u201d\nthat we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine\nwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by\nconsulting the trial record\u2014including charging docu\nments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,\nand jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26 (plurality opinion); Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990).

S. ___ (2009); United States\nv. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524\u2013525 (CA7\n2008) (same).\n   It may well be true, as the Government contends,\nthat in many cases state and local records from\nbattery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of\nrecords will often frustrate application of the modified\ncategorical approach\u2014not just to battery but to many\nother crimes as well. See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22\u201323\n(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common\nenough consequence with respect to the single crime of\nbattery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career\nCriminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art\nthat is a comical misfit with the defined term \u201cviolent\nfelony.\u201d\n                         *     *    *\n   The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh\nCircuit for its consideration of whether Johnson\u2019s 2003\nbattery conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning\nof the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d in 18 U.

S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).\nThe classic definition of the crime of battery is the \u201cinten\ntional application of unlawful force against the person of\nanother.\u201d Ante, at 5 (citing 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Sub\nstantive Criminal Law \u00a77.15, p. 301 (1986 and Supp.\n2003); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 173 (9th ed. 2009)). Thus,\nthe crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls\nsquarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I\nbelieve that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi\ntional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court\nof Appeals.\n                              I\n  The Court starts out in the right direction by noting\nthat the critical statutory language\u2014\u201cthe use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person\nof another,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014may mean either\n(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is\n\f2               JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.\nSee ante, at 4\u20135. The Court veers off course, however, by\nconcluding that the statutory language reaches only vio\nlent force.\n   The term \u201cforce,\u201d as the Court correctly notes, had a\nwell-established meaning at common law that included\neven the \u201cslightest offensive touching.\u201d Ante, at 5. See\nalso Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.\nPhila. 1784) (\u201c[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by\na blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet\nthese are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault\nand Battery. . .\u201d); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).\nThis approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent\ntouching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be\neven more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient\nto inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap\nin the face).\n   When Congress selects statutory language with a well\nknown common-law meaning, we generally presume that\nCongress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (\u201cWe\nrecognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a\ncommon-law term of established meaning without other\nwise defining it, the general practice is to give that term\nits common-law meaning\u201d); Morissette v. United States,\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Carll, 105 U. S.\n611, 612\u2013613 (1882). And here, I see nothing to suggest\nthat Congress meant the phrase \u201cuse of physical force\u201d in\nACCA to depart from that phrase\u2019s meaning at common\nlaw.\n   On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory\ninterpretation point to the same conclusion. \u201c[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal\nquotation     marks     omitted).         In    18     U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2014the clause immediately following the\nclause at issue in this case\u2014the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is\ndefined as including any crime that \u201cinvolves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not\ninclude a similar limitation in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should\npresume that it did not intend for such a limitation to\napply.\n   The language used by Congress in \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii)\nfurther illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,\namong other things, the possession of a firearm by a per\nson who is subject to a court order that \u201cexplicitly prohib\nits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against [an] intimate partner or child that would\nreasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Although \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until\neight years after \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former\nprovision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had\nwanted to include in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to\nthose in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress\ncould have easily done so expressly.\n                            II\n  The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com\nmon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.\n                             A\n  The Court first argues that \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read\nto refer to \u201cviolent\u201d force because that provision defines\nthe term \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Ante, at 6. But it is apparent\nthat ACCA uses \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a term of art with a\nwider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary\n\f4                   JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nusage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and\nextortion are \u201cviolent felon[ies],\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we\nhave held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted\nburglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nAll of these offenses may be committed without violent\nforce,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is\nnot a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies\ncrimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies\nbecause they often lead to violence. As we have put it,\nthese crimes create \u201csignificant risks of . . . confrontation\nthat might result in bodily injury,\u201d id., at 199, and offen\nsive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when\none bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse\nquence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d\n418, 422 (CA5 1996) (\u201cIf burglary, with its tendency to\ncause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is\nconsidered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(b), then\nsurely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that\noccurs when a child is sexually molested\u201d); United States\nv. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as \u201can unlawful or\n\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,\nwith intent to commit a crime.\u201d Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n598 (1990). See also James, 550 U. S., at 197, 198, 202\u2013203 (attempted\nburglary under Florida law requires \u201covert conduct directed toward\nunlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to\ncommit a felony therein\u201d and that the \u201cdefendant fail in the perpetra\ntion or be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the underlying\noffense\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we have not\ndefined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as \u201cthe obtain\ning of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use\nof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d 18 U.

The Court reasons that \u201c[i]t is unlikely\nthat Congress would select as a term of art defining \u2018vio\nlent felony\u2019 a phrase that the common law gave peculiar\nmeaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.\u201d Ante, at\n7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216\u2013218 (1769), and ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a7211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court\ndoes not spell out why Congress\u2019 selection of this term\nwould be unlikely, but I assume that the Court\u2019s point is\nthat Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a\nviolent felony an offense that was regarded at common law\nas a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the\nsignificance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the\nsubsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita\ntion imposed by 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   At common law, the terms \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d\ndid not have the same meaning as they do today. At that\ntime, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);\nmost felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.\nGarner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious\ncrimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to\nmurder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See\nUnited States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439\u2013440 (1976)\n(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the\nterm \u201cfelony\u201d has come to mean any offense punishable by\na lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one\nyear, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130\n(2008)); the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d has been reserved for\nminor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors\nat common law have been reclassified as felonies. And\nwhen the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a\nfew States had felony battery statutes that retained the\ncommon-law definition of \u201cforce.\u201d See Fla. Stat.\n\f6                  JOHNSON v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nno doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the\nCourt\u2019s decision will be to take all these convictions out\nside the scope of ACCA\u2014unless the Government is able to\nproduce documents that may properly be consulted under\nthe modified categorical approach and that conclusively\nshow that the offender\u2019s conduct involved the use of vio\nlent force, see ante, at 10\u201311. As the Government notes,\nhowever, this will often be impossible because, in those\nStates in which the same battery provision governs both\nthe use of violent force and offensive touching, charging\ndocuments frequently simply track the language of the\nstatute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to\ndraw distinctions based on the type of force that the de\nfendant employed. See Brief for United States 42\u201343.\n   In addition, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201cphysical force\u201d may hobble at least two federal statutes\nthat contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(9), a person convicted of a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d may not lawfully possess a firearm, and\nthe term \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is\ndefined as applying only to crimes that \u201cha[ve], as an\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (em\nphasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog\nnized that \u201c \u2018many people who engage in serious spousal or\nchild abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of\nfelonies,\u2019 \u201d and Congress therefore enacted this provision to\nkeep firearms out of the hands of such abusers.

SHATZER\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND\n\n   No. 08\u2013680.      Argued October 5, 2009\u2014Decided February 24, 2010\nIn 2003, a police detective tried to question respondent Shatzer, who\n  was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction,\n  about allegations that he had sexually abused his son. Shatzer in\n  voked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interroga\n  tion, so the detective terminated the interview. Shatzer was released\n  back into the general prison population, and the investigation was\n  closed. Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and at\n  tempted to interrogate Shatzer, who was still incarcerated. Shatzer\n  waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements. The\n  trial court refused to suppress those statements, reasoning that Ed\n  wards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, did not apply because Shatzer had\n  experienced a break in Miranda custody prior to the 2006 interroga\n  tion. Shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse. The Court of Ap\n  peals of Maryland reversed, holding that the mere passage of time\n  does not end the Edwards protections, and that, assuming, arguendo,\n  a break-in-custody exception to Edwards existed, Shatzer\u2019s release\n  back into the general prison population did not constitute such a\n  break.\nHeld: Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting\n more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at inter\n rogation, Edwards does not mandate suppression of his 2006 state\n ments. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the\n Miranda right to the presence of counsel, any waiver of that right in\n response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is\n involuntary. Edwards\u2019 fundamental purpose is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the\n integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only\n through counsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291, by \u201cpre\n vent[ing] police from badgering [him] into waiving his previously as\n\f2                        MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    serted Miranda rights,\u201d Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350. It is\n    easy to believe that a suspect\u2019s later waiver was coerced or badgered\n    when he has been held in uninterrupted Miranda custody since his\n    first refusal to waive. He remains cut off from his normal life and\n    isolated in a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n    U. S. 436, 456, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d Illi\n    nois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297. But where a suspect has been re\n    leased from custody and returned to his normal life for some time be\n    fore the later attempted interrogation, there is little reason to think\n    that his change of heart has been coerced. Because the Edwards pre\n    sumption has been established by opinion of this Court, it is appro\n    priate for this Court to specify the period of release from custody that\n    will terminate its application. See County of Riverside v. McLaugh\n    lin, 500 U. S. 44. The Court concludes that the appropriate period is\n    14 days, which provides ample time for the suspect to get reaccli\n    mated to his normal life, consult with friends and counsel, and shake\n    off any residual coercive effects of prior custody. Pp. 4\u201313.\n       (b) Shatzer\u2019s release back into the general prison population consti\n    tutes a break in Miranda custody. Lawful imprisonment imposed\n    upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by\n    investigative custody that justify Edwards. When previously incar\n    cerated suspects are released back into the general prison population,\n    they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014\n    they regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the\n    attempted interrogation. Their continued detention is relatively dis\n    connected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investiga\n    tion. The \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation\n    ended when Shatzer returned to his normal life.

S. 477 (1981).\n                             I\n  In August 2003, a social worker assigned to the Child\nAdvocacy Center in the Criminal Investigation Division of\nthe Hagerstown Police Department referred to the de\u00ad\npartment allegations that respondent Michael Shatzer,\nSr., had sexually abused his 3-year-old son. At that time,\nShatzer was incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional\nInstitution-Hagerstown, serving a sentence for an unre\u00ad\nlated child-sexual-abuse offense. Detective Shane Blank\u00ad\nenship was assigned to the investigation and interviewed\nShatzer at the correctional institution on August 7, 2003.\nBefore asking any questions, Blankenship reviewed\nShatzer\u2019s Miranda rights with him, and obtained a writ\u00ad\nten waiver of those rights. When Blankenship explained\nthat he was there to question Shatzer about sexually\nabusing his son, Shatzer expressed confusion\u2014he had\nthought Blankenship was an attorney there to discuss the\n\f2                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprior crime for which he was incarcerated. Blankenship\nclarified the purpose of his visit, and Shatzer declined to\nspeak without an attorney. Accordingly, Blankenship\nended the interview, and Shatzer was released back into\nthe general prison population.          Shortly thereafter,\nBlankenship closed the investigation.\n   Two years and six months later, the same social worker\nreferred more specific allegations to the department about\nthe same incident involving Shatzer. Detective Paul\nHoover, from the same division, was assigned to the inves\u00ad\ntigation. He and the social worker interviewed the victim,\nthen eight years old, who described the incident in more\ndetail. With this new information in hand, on March 2,\n2006, they went to the Roxbury Correctional Institute, to\nwhich Shatzer had since been transferred, and inter\u00ad\nviewed Shatzer in a maintenance room outfitted with a\ndesk and three chairs. Hoover explained that he wanted\nto ask Shatzer about the alleged incident involving\nShatzer\u2019s son. Shatzer was surprised because he thought\nthat the investigation had been closed, but Hoover ex\u00ad\nplained they had opened a new file. Hoover then read\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtained a written waiver\non a standard department form.\n   Hoover interrogated Shatzer about the incident for\napproximately 30 minutes. Shatzer denied ordering his\nson to perform fellatio on him, but admitted to masturbat\u00ad\ning in front of his son from a distance of less than three\nfeet. Before the interview ended, Shatzer agreed to Hoo\u00ad\nver\u2019s request that he submit to a polygraph examination.\nAt no point during the interrogation did Shatzer request\nto speak with an attorney or refer to his prior refusal to\nanswer questions without one.\n   Five days later, on March 7, 2006, Hoover and another\ndetective met with Shatzer at the correctional facility to\nadminister the polygraph examination. After reading\nShatzer his Miranda rights and obtaining a written\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwaiver, the other detective administered the test and\nconcluded that Shatzer had failed. When the detectives\nthen questioned Shatzer, he became upset, started to cry,\nand incriminated himself by saying, \u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t force him. I\ndidn\u2019t force him.\u2019 \u201d 405 Md. 585, 590, 954 A. 2d 1118, 1121\n(2008). After making this inculpatory statement, Shatzer\nrequested an attorney, and Hoover promptly ended the\ninterrogation.\n   The State\u2019s Attorney for Washington County charged\nShatzer with second-degree sexual offense, sexual child\nabuse, second-degree assault, and contributing to condi\u00ad\ntions rendering a child in need of assistance. Shatzer\nmoved to suppress his March 2006 statements pursuant to\nEdwards. The trial court held a suppression hearing and\nlater denied Shatzer\u2019s motion. The Edwards protections\ndid not apply, it reasoned, because Shatzer had experi\u00ad\nenced a break in custody for Miranda purposes between\nthe 2003 and 2006 interrogations. No. 21\u2013K\u201306\u201337799\n(Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 14, 2006), App. 55.\nShatzer pleaded not guilty, waived his right to a jury trial,\nand proceeded to a bench trial based on an agreed state\u00ad\nment of facts. In accordance with the agreement, the\nState described the interview with the victim and\nShatzer\u2019s 2006 statements to the detectives. Based on the\nproffered testimony of the victim and the \u201cadmission of the\ndefendant as to the act of masturbation,\u201d the trial court\nfound Shatzer guilty of sexual child abuse of his son.1 No.\n21\u2013K\u201306\u201337799 (Cir. Ct. Washington Cty., Md., Sept. 21,\n2006), id., at 70, 79.\n   Over the dissent of two judges, the Court of Appeals of\nMaryland reversed and remanded.

We\ngranted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n   The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the States by\nvirtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan,\n378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964), provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall\nbe compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. In Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted a set of prophylac\u00ad\ntic measures to protect a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment right\nfrom the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial\ninterrogation. Id., at 467. The Court observed that \u201cin\u00ad\ncommunicado interrogation\u201d in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d \u201cpolice\u00ad\ndominated atmosphere,\u201d id., at 456\u2013457, involves psycho\u00ad\nlogical pressures \u201cwhich work to undermine the individ\u00ad\nual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he\nwould not otherwise do so freely,\u201d id., at 467. Conse\u00ad\nquently, it reasoned, \u201c[u]nless adequate protective devices\nare employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custo\u00ad\ndial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defen\u00ad\ndant can truly be the product of his free choice.\u201d Id., at\n458.\n   To counteract the coercive pressure, Miranda an\u00ad\nnounced that police officers must warn a suspect prior to\nquestioning that he has a right to remain silent, and a\nright to the presence of an attorney. Id., at 444. After the\nwarnings are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes\nto remain silent, the interrogation must cease. Id., at\n473\u2013474. Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an\nattorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is\npresent. Id., at 474. Critically, however, a suspect can\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwaive these rights. Id., at 475. To establish a valid\nwaiver, the State must show that the waiver was knowing,\nintelligent, and voluntary under the \u201chigh standar[d] of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights [set forth in]\nJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).\u201d Id., at 475.\n   In Edwards, the Court determined that Zerbst\u2019s tradi\u00ad\ntional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a\nsuspect\u2019s right to have counsel present at a subsequent\ninterrogation if he had previously requested counsel;\n\u201cadditional safeguards\u201d were necessary. 451 U. S., at 484.\nThe Court therefore superimposed a \u201csecond layer of\nprophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176\n(1991). Edwards held:\n    \u201c[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have\n    counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid\n    waiver of that right cannot be established by showing\n    only that he responded to further police-initiated cus\u00ad\n    todial interrogation even if he has been advised of his\n    rights. . . . [He] is not subject to further interrogation\n    by the authorities until counsel has been made avail\u00ad\n    able to him, unless the accused himself initiates fur\u00ad\n    ther communication, exchanges, or conversations with\n    the police.\u201d 451 U. S., at 484\u2013485.\nThe rationale of Edwards is that once a suspect indicates\nthat \u201che is not capable of undergoing [custodial] question\u00ad\ning without advice of counsel,\u201d \u201cany subsequent waiver\nthat has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the\nsuspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of the \u2018in\u00ad\nherently compelling pressures\u2019 and not the purely volun\u00ad\ntary choice of the suspect.\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.\n675, 681 (1988). Under this rule, a voluntary Miranda\nwaiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted\ninterrogation to protect a suspect\u2019s right to have counsel\npresent, but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent\nattempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of\n\f6                  MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the\nsubsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly\ngreater risk of coercion. That increased risk results not\nonly from the police\u2019s persistence in trying to get the sus\u00ad\npect to talk, but also from the continued pressure that\nbegins when the individual is taken into custody as a\nsuspect and sought to be interrogated\u2014pressure likely to\n\u201cincrease as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick v. Mississippi,\n498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990). The Edwards presumption of\ninvoluntariness ensures that police will not take advan\u00ad\ntage of the mounting coercive pressures of \u201cprolonged\npolice custody,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686, by repeatedly\nattempting to question a suspect who previously requested\ncounsel until the suspect is \u201cbadgered into submission,\u201d\nid., at 690 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   We have frequently emphasized that the Edwards rule\nis not a constitutional mandate, but judicially prescribed\nprophylaxis. See, e.g., Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 7\u20138); Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S.\n344, 349 (1990); Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, 644, n. 4\n(1984). Because Edwards is \u201cour rule, not a constitutional\ncommand,\u201d \u201cit is our obligation to justify its expansion.\u201d\nRoberson, supra, at 688 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Lower\ncourts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends\nthe Edwards presumption, see, e.g., People v. Storm, 28\nCal. 4th 1007, 1023\u20131024, and n. 6, 52 P. 3d 52, 61\u201362,\nand n. 6 (2002) (collecting state and federal cases), but we\nhave previously addressed the issue only in dicta, see\nMcNeil, supra, at 177 (Edwards applies \u201cassuming there\nhas been no break in custody\u201d).\n   A judicially crafted rule is \u201cjustified only by reference to\nits prophylactic purpose,\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S.\n452, 458 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\napplies only where its benefits outweigh its costs, Montejo,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). We begin with the benefits.\nEdwards\u2019 presumption of involuntariness has the inciden\u00ad\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntal effect of \u201cconserv[ing] judicial resources which would\notherwise be expended in making difficult determinations\nof voluntariness.\u201d Minnick, supra, at 151. Its fundamen\u00ad\ntal purpose, however, is to \u201c[p]reserv[e] the integrity of an\naccused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through\ncounsel,\u201d Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 291 (1988), by\n\u201cprevent[ing] police from badgering a defendant into waiv\u00ad\ning his previously asserted Miranda rights,\u201d Harvey,\nsupra, at 350. Thus, the benefits of the rule are measured\nby the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that\notherwise would have been admitted. See Montejo, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   It is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or\nbadgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be ques\u00ad\ntioned without counsel in the paradigm Edwards case.\nThat is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a\nparticular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial\ncustody while that crime is being actively investigated.\nAfter the initial interrogation, and up to and including the\nsecond one, he remains cut off from his normal life and\ncompanions, \u201cthrust into\u201d and isolated in an \u201cunfamiliar,\u201d\n\u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere,\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at\n456\u2013457, where his captors \u201cappear to control [his] fate,\u201d\nIllinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 297 (1990). That was the\nsituation confronted by the suspects in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, the three cases in which we have\nheld the Edwards rule applicable. Edwards was arrested\npursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station, where\nhe was interrogated until he requested counsel. Edwards,\n451 U. S., at 478\u2013479.

Roberson was arrested\n\u201cat the scene of a just-completed burglary\u201d and interro\u00ad\ngated there until he requested a lawyer. Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 678. A different officer interrogated him three\ndays later while he \u201cwas still in custody pursuant to the\narrest.\u201d Ibid. Minnick was arrested by local police and\ntaken to the San Diego jail, where two FBI agents interro\u00ad\ngated him the next morning until he requested counsel.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 148\u2013149. Two days later a Missis\u00ad\nsippi Deputy Sheriff reinterrogated him at the jail. Id., at\n149. None of these suspects regained a sense of control or\nnormalcy after they were initially taken into custody for\nthe crime under investigation.\n   When, unlike what happened in these three cases, a\nsuspect has been released from his pretrial custody and\nhas returned to his normal life for some time before the\nlater attempted interrogation, there is little reason to\nthink that his change of heart regarding interrogation\nwithout counsel has been coerced. He has no longer been\nisolated. He has likely been able to seek advice from an\nattorney, family members, and friends.3 And he knows\nfrom his earlier experience that he need only demand\ncounsel to bring the interrogation to a halt; and that in\u00ad\nvestigative custody does not last indefinitely. In these\ncircumstances, it is far fetched to think that a police offi\u00ad\ncer\u2019s asking the suspect whether he would like to waive\nhis Miranda rights will any more \u201cwear down the ac\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 JUSTICESTEVENS points out, post, at 7 (opinion concurring in judg\u00ad\nment), that in Minnick, actual pre-reinterrogation consultation with an\nattorney during continued custody did not suffice to avoid application of\nEdwards. That does not mean that the ability to consult freely with\nattorneys and others does not reduce the level of coercion at all, or that\nit is \u201conly questionably relevant,\u201d post, at 7, to whether termination of\ncustody reduces the coercive pressure that is the basis for Edwards\u2019\nsuper-prophylactic rule.\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncused,\u201d Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98 (1984) (per cu\nriam), than did the first such request at the original at\u00ad\ntempted interrogation\u2014which is of course not deemed\ncoercive. His change of heart is less likely attributable to\n\u201cbadgering\u201d than it is to the fact that further deliberation\nin familiar surroundings has caused him to believe\n(rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with the investiga\u00ad\ntion is in his interest. Uncritical extension of Edwards to\nthis situation would not significantly increase the number\nof genuinely coerced confessions excluded. The \u201cjustifica\u00ad\ntion for a conclusive presumption disappears when appli\u00ad\ncation of the presumption will not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,\n737 (1991).\n   At the same time that extending the Edwards rule\nyields diminished benefits, extending the rule also in\u00ad\ncreases its costs: the in-fact voluntary confessions it ex\u00ad\ncludes from trial, and the voluntary confessions it deters\nlaw enforcement officers from even trying to obtain. Vol\u00ad\nuntary confessions are not merely \u201ca proper element in\nlaw enforcement,\u201d Miranda, supra, at 478, they are an\n\u201cunmitigated good,\u201d McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181, \u201c \u2018essential\nto society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and\npunishing those who violate the law,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).\n   The only logical endpoint of Edwards disability is ter\u00ad\nmination of Miranda custody and any of its lingering\neffects. Without that limitation\u2014and barring some purely\narbitrary time-limit4\u2014every Edwards prohibition of cus\u00ad\ntodial interrogation of a particular suspect would be eter\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  State\u2019s alternative argument in the present case is that the\nsubstantial lapse in time between the 2003 and 2006 attempts at\ninterrogation independently ended the Edwards presumption. Our\ndisposition makes it unnecessary to address that argument.\n\f10                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnal. The prohibition applies, of course, when the subse\u00ad\nquent interrogation pertains to a different crime,\nRoberson, supra, when it is conducted by a different law\nenforcement authority, Minnick, 498 U. S. 146, and even\nwhen the suspect has met with an attorney after the first\ninterrogation, ibid. And it not only prevents questioning\nex ante; it would render invalid ex post, confessions invited\nand obtained from suspects who (unbeknownst to the\ninterrogators) have acquired Edwards immunity previ\u00ad\nously in connection with any offense in any jurisdiction.5\nIn a country that harbors a large number of repeat offend\u00ad\ners,6 this consequence is disastrous.\n  We conclude that such an extension of Edwards is not\njustified; we have opened its \u201cprotective umbrella,\u201d Solem,\n465 U. S., at 644, n. 4, far enough. The protections offered\nby Miranda, which we have deemed sufficient to ensure\nthat the police respect the suspect\u2019s desire to have an\nattorney present the first time police interrogate him,\nadequately ensure that result when a suspect who initially\nrequested counsel is reinterrogated after a break in cus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 This assumes that Roberson\u2019s extension of Edwards to subsequent\n\ninterrogation for a different crime, and Minnick\u2019s extension of Edwards\nto subsequent interrogation by a different law enforcement agency\nwould apply even when the place of custody and the identity of the\ncustodial agency are not the same (as they were in Roberson and\nMinnick) as those of the original interrogation. That assumption would\nseem reasonable if the Edwards-suspending effect of a termination of\ncustody is rejected. Reinterrogation in different custody or by a differ\u00ad\nent interrogating agency would seem, if anything, less likely than\ntermination of custody to reduce coercive pressures. At the original\nsite, and with respect to the original interrogating agency, the suspect\nhas already experienced cessation of interrogation when he demands\ncounsel\u2014which he may have no reason to expect elsewhere.\n   6 According to a recent study, 67.5% of prisoners released from 15\n\nStates in 1994 were rearrested within three years. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report, Recidivism of Prisoners\nReleased in 1994 (NCJ 193427, 2002).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive\neffects.\n  If Shatzer\u2019s return to the general prison population\nqualified as a break in custody (a question we address in\nPart III, infra), there is no doubt that it lasted long\nenough (2\u00bd years) to meet that durational requirement.\nBut what about a break that has lasted only one year? Or\nonly one week? It is impractical to leave the answer to\nthat question for clarification in future case-by-case adju\u00ad\ndication; law enforcement officers need to know, with\ncertainty and beforehand, when renewed interrogation is\nlawful. And while it is certainly unusual for this Court to\nset forth precise time limits governing police action, it is\nnot unheard-of. In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n500 U. S. 44 (1991), we specified 48 hours as the time\nwithin which the police must comply with the requirement\nof Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), that a person\narrested without a warrant be brought before a magistrate\nto establish probable cause for continued detention.\n  Like McLaughlin, this is a case in which the requisite\npolice action (there, presentation to a magistrate; here,\nabstention from further interrogation) has not been pre\u00ad\nscribed by statute but has been established by opinion of\nthis Court. We think it appropriate to specify a period of\ntime to avoid the consequence that continuation of the\nEdwards presumption \u201cwill not reach the correct result\nmost of the time.\u201d Coleman, supra, at 737. It seems to us\nthat period is 14 days. That provides plenty of time for\nthe suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to con\u00ad\nsult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any resid\u00ad\nual coercive effects of his prior custody.\n  The 14-day limitation meets Shatzer\u2019s concern that a\nbreak-in-custody rule lends itself to police abuse. He\nenvisions that once a suspect invokes his Miranda right to\ncounsel, the police will release the suspect briefly (to end\nthe Edwards presumption) and then promptly bring him\n\f12                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nback into custody for reinterrogation. But once the sus\u00ad\npect has been out of custody long enough (14 days) to\neliminate its coercive effect, there will be nothing to gain\nby such gamesmanship\u2014nothing, that is, except the en\u00ad\ntirely appropriate gain of being able to interrogate a sus\u00ad\npect who has made a valid waiver of his Miranda rights.7\n   Shatzer argues that ending the Edwards protections at\na break in custody will undermine Edwards\u2019 purpose to\nconserve judicial resources. To be sure, we have said that\n\u201c[t]he merit of the Edwards decision lies in the clarity of\nits command and the certainty of its application.\u201d\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 151. But clarity and certainty are\nnot goals in themselves. They are valuable only when\nthey reasonably further the achievement of some substan\u00ad\ntive end\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions.\nConfessions obtained after a 2-week break in custody and\na waiver of Miranda rights are most unlikely to be com\u00ad\npelled, and hence are unreasonably excluded. In any case,\na break-in-custody exception will dim only marginally, if\nat all, the bright-line nature of Edwards. In every case\ninvolving Edwards, the courts must determine whether\nthe suspect was in custody when he requested counsel and\nwhen he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.\nNow, in cases where there is an alleged break in custody,\nthey simply have to repeat the inquiry for the time be\u00ad\ntween the initial invocation and reinterrogation. In most\ncases that determination will be easy. And when it is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A defendant who experiences a 14-day break in custody after invok\u00ad\n\ning the Miranda right to counsel is not left without protection. Ed\nwards establishes a presumption that a suspect\u2019s waiver of Miranda\nrights is involuntary. See Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 681\n(1988). Even without this \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis,\u201d McNeil v.\nWisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), a defendant is still free to claim\nthe prophylactic protection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of\nMiranda rights was in fact involuntary under Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938). See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the defendant pleading Edwards has\nbeen out of custody for two weeks before the contested\ninterrogation, the court is spared the fact-intensive in\u00ad\nquiry into whether he ever, anywhere, asserted his\nMiranda right to counsel.\n                             III\n  The facts of this case present an additional issue. No\none questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda\npurposes during the interviews with Detective\nBlankenship in 2003 and Detective Hoover in 2006. Like\u00ad\nwise, no one questions that Shatzer triggered the Edwards\nprotections when, according to Detective Blankenship\u2019s\nnotes of the 2003 interview, he stated that \u201c \u2018he would not\ntalk about this case without having an attorney present,\u2019 \u201d\n405 Md., at 589, 954 A. 2d, at 1120. After the 2003 inter\u00ad\nview, Shatzer was released back into the general prison\npopulation where he was serving an unrelated sentence.\nThe issue is whether that constitutes a break in Miranda\ncustody.\n  We have never decided whether incarceration consti\u00ad\ntutes custody for Miranda purposes, and have indeed\nexplicitly declined to address the issue. See Perkins, 496\nU. S., at 299. See also Bradley v. Ohio, 497 U. S. 1011,\n1013 (1990) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). Whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the\ncoercive pressure that Miranda was designed to guard\nagainst\u2014the \u201cdanger of coercion [that] results from the\ninteraction of custody and official interrogation.\u201d Perkins,\nsupra, at 297 (emphasis added). To determine whether a\nsuspect was in Miranda custody we have asked whether\n\u201cthere is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of move\u00ad\nment\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d New\nYork v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984); see also Stans\nbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322 (1994) (per curiam).\nThis test, no doubt, is satisfied by all forms of incarcera\u00ad\n\f14                    MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion. Our cases make clear, however, that the freedom-of\u00ad\nmovement test identifies only a necessary and not a suffi\u00ad\ncient condition for Miranda custody. We have declined to\naccord it \u201ctalismanic power,\u201d because Miranda is to be\nenforced \u201conly in those types of situations in which the\nconcerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d\nBerkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437 (1984). Thus, the\ntemporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in\u00ad\nvolved in a traffic stop or Terry stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968), does not constitute Miranda custody.\nMcCarty, supra, at 439\u2013440. See also Perkins, supra, at\n296.\n   Here, we are addressing the interim period during\nwhich a suspect was not interrogated, but was subject to a\nbaseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior\nconviction. Without minimizing the harsh realities of\nincarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed\nupon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive\npressures identified in Miranda.\n   Interrogated suspects who have previously been con\u00ad\nvicted of crime live in prison. When they are released\nback into the general prison population, they return to\ntheir accustomed surroundings and daily routine\u2014they\nregain the degree of control they had over their lives prior\nto the interrogation. Sentenced prisoners, in contrast to\nthe Miranda paradigm, are not isolated with their accus\u00ad\ners. They live among other inmates, guards, and workers,\nand often can receive visitors and communicate with\npeople on the outside by mail or telephone.\n   Their detention, moreover, is relatively disconnected\nfrom their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investi\u00ad\ngation. The former interrogator has no power to increase\nthe duration of incarceration, which was determined at\nsentencing.8 And even where the possibility of parole\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 We   distinguish the duration of incarceration from the duration of\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nexists, the former interrogator has no apparent power to\ndecrease the time served. This is in stark contrast to the\ncircumstances faced by the defendants in Edwards,\nRoberson, and Minnick, whose continued detention as\nsuspects rested with those controlling their interrogation,\nand who confronted the uncertainties of what final\ncharges they would face, whether they would be convicted,\nand what sentence they would receive.\n   Shatzer\u2019s experience illustrates the vast differences\nbetween Miranda custody and incarceration pursuant to\nconviction. At the time of the 2003 attempted interroga\u00ad\ntion, Shatzer was already serving a sentence for a prior\nconviction. After that, he returned to the general prison\npopulation in the Maryland Correctional Institution-\nHagerstown and was later transferred, for unrelated\nreasons, down the street to the Roxbury Correctional\nInstitute. Both are medium-security state correctional\nfacilities. See Maryland Div. of Correction Inmate Hand\u00ad\nbook 7 (2007), online at http://dpscs.md.gov/rehabservs/\ndoc/pdfs/2007_Inmate_Handbook.pdf (all Internet materi\u00ad\nals as visited Feb. 22, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).

When a prisoner is\nremoved from the general prison population and taken to a separate\nlocation for questioning, the duration of that separation is assuredly\ndependent upon his interrogators. For which reason once he has\nasserted a refusal to speak without assistance of counsel Edwards\nprevents any efforts to get him to change his mind during that inter\u00ad\nrogative custody.\n\f16                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntention after the 2003 interrogation did not depend on\nwhat he said (or did not say) to Detective Blankenship,\nand he has not alleged that he was placed in a higher level\nof security or faced any continuing restraints as a result of\nthe 2003 interrogation. The \u201cinherently compelling pres\u00ad\nsures\u201d of custodial interrogation ended when he returned\nto his normal life.\n                                IV\n  A few words in response to JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 concur\u00ad\nrence: It claims we ignore that \u201c[w]hen police tell an indi\u00ad\ngent suspect that he has the right to an attorney\u201d and\nthen \u201creinterrogate\u201d him without providing a lawyer, \u201cthe\nsuspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that\nhe really does not have any right to a lawyer.\u201d Post, at 2\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (hereinafter concur\u00ad\nrence). See also post, at 4, 7, n. 11, 11, n. 16. The fallacy\nhere is that we are not talking about \u201creinterrogating\u201d the\nsuspect; we are talking about asking his permission to be\ninterrogated. An officer has in no sense lied to a suspect\nwhen, after advising, as Miranda requires, \u201cYou have the\nright to remain silent, and if you choose to speak you have\nthe right to the presence of an attorney,\u201d he promptly ends\nthe attempted interrogation because the suspect declines\nto speak without counsel present, and then, two weeks\nlater, reapproaches the suspect and asks, \u201cAre you now\nwilling to speak without a lawyer present?\u201d\n  The \u201cconcer[n] that motivated the Edwards line of\ncases,\u201d post, at 2\u20133, n. 2, is that the suspect will be coerced\ninto saying yes. That concern guides our decision today.\nContrary to the concurrence\u2019s conclusion, post, at 3, 5\u20136,\nthere is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession\nas \u201c \u2018the only way to end his interrogation\u2019 \u201d when, before\nthe interrogation begins, he is told that he can avoid it by\nsimply requesting that he not be interrogated without\ncounsel present\u2014an option that worked before. If, as the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

We do not ignore these\npressures; nor do we suggest that they disappear when\ncustody is recommenced after a break, see post, at 5. But\nif those pressures are merely \u201cthe same\u201d as before, then\nMiranda provides sufficient protection\u2014as it did before.\nThe Edwards presumption of involuntariness is justified\nonly in circumstances where the coercive pressures have\nincreased so much that suspects\u2019 waivers of Miranda\nrights are likely to be involuntary most of the time. Con\u00ad\ntrary to the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, post, at 3, it is only\nin those narrow circumstances\u2014when custody is unbro\u00ad\nken\u2014that the Court has concluded a \u201cfresh se[t] of\nMiranda warnings\u201d is not sufficient. See Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 686.\n   In the last analysis, it turns out that the concurrence\naccepts our principal points. It agrees that Edwards\nprophylaxis is not perpetual; it agrees that a break in\ncustody reduces the inherently compelling pressure upon\nwhich Edwards was based; it agrees that Shatzer\u2019s release\nback into the general prison population constituted a\nbreak in custody; and it agrees that in this case the break\nwas long enough to render Edwards inapplicable. Post, at\n10\u201312. We differ in two respects: Instead of terminating\nEdwards protection when the custodial pressures that\nwere the basis for that protection dissipate, the concur\u00ad\nrence would terminate it when the suspect would no\nlonger \u201cfeel that he has \u2018been denied the counsel he has\nclearly requested,\u2019 \u201d post, at 11. This is entirely unrelated\nto the rationale of Edwards. If confidence in the police\u2019s\n\f18                 MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npromise to provide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards\nwould not have applied in Minnick, where the suspect in\ncontinuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.\nThe concurrence\u2019s rule is also entirely unrelated to the\nexistence of a break in custody. While that may relieve\nthe accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the\nfoundation for Edwards, it is hard to see how it bolsters\nthe suspect\u2019s confidence that if he asks for counsel he will\nget one.\n   And secondly, the concurrence differs from us in declin\u00ad\ning to say how long after a break in custody the termina\u00ad\ntion of Edwards protection occurs. Two and one-half\nyears, it says, is clearly enough\u2014but it gives law enforce\u00ad\nment authorities no further guidance. The concurrence\ncriticizes our use of 14 days as arbitrary and unexplained,\npost, at 5, and n. 7. But in fact that rests upon the same\nbasis as the concurrence\u2019s own approval of a 21\u20442-year\nbreak in custody: how much time will justify \u201ctreating the\nsecond interrogation as no more coercive than the first,\u201d\npost, at 10. Failure to say where the line falls short of 21\u20442\nyears, and leaving that for future case-by-case determina\u00ad\ntion, is certainly less helpful, but not at all less arbitrary.\n                        *     *     *\n  Because Shatzer experienced a break in Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody lasting more than two weeks between the first and\nsecond attempts at interrogation, Edwards does not man\u00ad\ndate suppression of his March 2006 statements.

I do not join the Court\u2019s decision to\nextend the presumption of involuntariness established in\nEdwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), for 14 days after\ncustody ends.\n   It is not apparent to me that the presumption of in\nvoluntariness the Court recognized in Edwards is justifi\nable even in the custodial setting to which Edwards ap\nplies it. See, e.g., Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146,\n160 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Accordingly, I would\nnot extend the Edwards rule \u201cbeyond the circumstances\npresent in Edwards itself.\u201d Id., at 162. But even if one\nbelieves that the Court is obliged to apply Edwards to any\ncase involving continuing custody, the Court\u2019s opinion\ntoday goes well beyond that. It extends the presumption\nof involuntariness Edwards applies in custodial settings to\ninterrogations that occur after custody ends.\n   The Court concedes that this extension, like the Ed\nwards presumption itself, is not constitutionally required.\nThe Court nevertheless defends the extension as a judi\ncially created prophylaxis against compelled confessions.\nEven if one accepts that such prophylaxis is both permis\n\f2                     MARYLAND v.

Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), maintain \u201cthe closest possible fit\u201d\nbetween the rule and the Fifth Amendment interests they\nseek to protect. United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,\n640\u2013641 (2004) (plurality opinion); see generally Montejo\nv. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18);\nChavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 772 (2003) (plurality\nopinion). The Court\u2019s 14-day rule does not satisfy this\ntest. The Court relates its 14-day rule to the Fifth\nAmendment simply by asserting that 14 days between\nrelease and recapture should provide \u201cplenty of time for\nthe suspect . . . to shake off any residual coercive effects of\nhis prior custody,\u201d ante, at 11.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At a minimum the latter proposition is questionable. I concede that\n\nsome police officers might badger a suspect during a subsequent inter\nrogation after a break in custody, or might use catch-and-release tactics\nto suggest they will not take no for an answer. But if a suspect reenters\ncustody after being questioned and released, he need only invoke his\nright to counsel to ensure Edwards\u2019 protection for the duration of the\nsubsequent detention. And, if law enforcement officers repeatedly\nrelease and recapture a suspect to wear down his will\u2014such that his\nparticipation in a subsequent interrogation is no longer truly volun\ntary\u2014the \u201chigh standar[d] of proof for the waiver of constitutional\nrights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938),\u201d will\nprotect against the admission of the suspect\u2019s statements in court.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 475 (1966). The Zerbst inquiry\ntakes into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the\nwaiver\u2014including any improper pressures by police. See id., at 464; cf.\nante, at 11\u201312, n. 6 (stating that \u201c[e]ven without [Edwards\u2019] second\nlayer of prophylaxis, a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic\nprotection of Miranda\u2014arguing that his waiver of Miranda rights was\nin fact involuntary under Johnson v.

Nor does it explain how the benefits of a prophy\nlactic 14-day rule (either on its own terms or compared\nwith other possible rules) \u201coutweigh its costs\u201d (which\nwould include the loss of law enforcement information as\nwell as the exclusion of confessions that are in fact volun\ntary). Ante, at 6 (citing Montejo, supra, at __ (slip op., at\n14)).\n   To be sure, the Court\u2019s rule has the benefit of providing\na bright line. Ante, at 12. But bright-line rules are not\nnecessary to prevent Fifth Amendment violations, as the\nCourt has made clear when refusing to adopt such rules in\ncases involving other Miranda rights. See, e.g., Michigan\nv. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103\u2013104 (1975). And an otherwise\narbitrary rule is not justifiable merely because it gives\nclear instruction to law enforcement officers.2\n   As the Court concedes, \u201cclarity and certainty are not\ngoals in themselves. They are valuable only when they\nreasonably further the achievement of some substantive\nend\u2014here, the exclusion of compelled confessions\u201d that\nthe Fifth Amendment prohibits. Ante, at 12. The Court\u2019s\narbitrary 14-day rule fails this test, even under the rela\ntively permissive criteria set forth in our precedents.\nAccordingly, I do not join that portion of the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Though the Court asserts that its 14-day rule will tell \u201claw enforce\n\nment officers . . . with certainty and beforehand, when renewed interro\ngation is lawful,\u201d ante, at 10, that is not so clear. Determining whether\na suspect was previously in custody, and when the suspect was re\nleased, may be difficult without questioning the suspect, especially if\nstate and federal authorities are conducting simultaneous investiga\ntions.\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

S. 477 (1981), is not \u201ceternal,\u201d ante, at 9\u2013\n10, and does not mandate suppression of Shatzer\u2019s state\u00ad\nment made after a 2\u00bd-year break in custody, I do not\nagree with the Court\u2019s newly announced rule: that Ed\nwards always ceases to apply when there is a 14-day\nbreak in custody, ante, at 11.\n  In conducting its \u201ccost-benefit\u201d analysis, the Court\ndemeans Edwards as a \u201c \u2018second layer\u2019 \u201d of \u201cjudicially pre\u00ad\nscribed prophylaxis,\u201d ante, at 5, 6, 12, n. 7; see also ante, at\n6 (describing Edwards as \u201c \u2018our rule, not a constitutional\ncommand\u2019 \u201d (quoting Arizona v.

When police tell an indigent suspect that he has\nthe right to an attorney, that he is not required to speak\nwithout an attorney present, and that an attorney will be\nprovided to him at no cost before questioning, the police\nhave made a significant promise. If they cease question\u00ad\ning and then reinterrogate the suspect 14 days later with\u00ad\nout providing him with a lawyer, the suspect is likely to\nfeel that the police lied to him and that he really does not\nhave any right to a lawyer.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFourteenth Amendments were violated by the use of his confession\nobtained by police-instigated interrogation\u2014without counsel present\u2014\nafter he requested an attorney\u201d); Oregon v.

S. 1039,\n1043 (1983) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[The] subsequent incriminating\nstatements made without [an] attorney present violated the rights\nsecured to the defendant by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nthe United States Constitution\u201d); Miranda, 384 U. S., at 458 (examin\u00ad\ning the \u201chistory and precedent underlying the Self-Incrimination\nClause to determine its applicability in this situation\u201d).\n   2 The Court states that this argument rests on a \u201cfallacy\u201d because \u201cwe\n\nare not talking about \u2018reinterrogating\u2019 the suspect; we are talking about\nasking his permission to be interrogated.\u201d Ante, at 16 (emphasis\ndeleted). Because, however, a suspect always has the right to remain\nsilent, this is a distinction without a difference: Any time that the\npolice interrogate or reinterrogate, and read a suspect his Miranda\nrights, the suspect may decline to speak. And if this is a \u201cfallacy,\u201d it is\nthe same \u201cfallacy\u201d upon which this Court has relied in the Edwards line\nof cases that held that police may not continue to interrogate a suspect\nwho has requested a lawyer: Police may not continue to ask such a\nsuspect whether they may interrogate him until that suspect has a\nlawyer present. The Court\u2019s apparent belief that this is a \u201cfallacy\u201d only\nunderscores my concern that its analysis is insufficiently sensitive to\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

But if an\nindigent suspect requests a lawyer, \u201cany further interro\u00ad\ngation\u201d (even 14 days later) \u201cwithout counsel having been\nprovided will surely exacerbate whatever compulsion to\nspeak the suspect may be feeling.\u201d Roberson, 486 U.

When police have not honored an earlier commit\u00ad\nment to provide a detainee with a lawyer, the detainee\nlikely will \u201cunderstan[d] his (expressed) wishes to have\nbeen ignored\u201d and \u201cmay well see further objection as futile\nand confession (true or not) as the only way to end his\ninterrogation.\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 472\u2013\n473 (1994) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). Cf. Coo\nper v. Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1225 (CA9 1992) (en banc)\n(describing an elaborate police task force plan to ignore a\nsuspect\u2019s requests for counsel, on the theory that such\nwould induce hopelessness and thereby elicit an admis\u00ad\nsion). Simply giving a \u201cfresh se[t] of Miranda warnings\u201d\nwill not \u201c \u2018reassure\u2019 a suspect who has been denied the\ncounsel he has clearly requested that his rights have\nremained untrammeled.\u201d Roberson, 486 U.

Instead,\nthe Court simply decides to create a time-based rule, and\nin so doing, disregards much of the analysis upon which\nEdwards and subsequent decisions were based. \u201c[T]he\nassertion of the right to counsel\u201d \u201c[i]s a significant event.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe concerns that motivated the Edwards line of cases.\n  3 Indeed, a lawyer has a \u201cunique ability to protect the Fifth Amend\u00ad\n\nment rights of a client undergoing custodial interrogation.\u201d Fare v.\n\f4                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nEdwards, 451 U. S., at 485. As the Court today acknowl\u00ad\nedges, the right to counsel, like the right to remain silent,\nis one that police may \u201ccoerc[e] or badge[r],\u201d ante, at 7, a\nsuspect into abandoning.4 However, as discussed above,\nthe Court ignores the effects not of badgering but of rein\u00ad\nterrogating a suspect who took the police at their word\nthat he need not answer questions without an attorney\npresent. See Roberson, 486 U. S., at 686. The Court,\nmoreover, ignores that when a suspect asks for counsel,\nuntil his request is answered, there are still the same\n\u201cinherently compelling\u201d pressures of custodial interroga\u00ad\ntion on which the Miranda line of cases is based, see 486\nU. S., at 681,5 and that the concern about compulsion is\nespecially serious for a detainee who has requested a\nlawyer, an act that signals his \u201cinability to cope with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMichael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719 (1979). Counsel can curb an officer\u2019s\noverbearing conduct, advise a suspect of his rights, and ensure that\nthere is an accurate record of any interrogation. \u201cBecause of this\nspecial ability of the lawyer to help the client preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights once the client becomes enmeshed in the adversary\nprocess, the Court found that the right to have counsel present at the\ninterrogation is indispensible to the protection of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege.\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682, n. 4 (1988) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201conce the accused has requested\ncounsel,\u201d courts must be especially wary of \u201ccoercive form[s] of custodial\ninterrogation.\u201d Bradshaw, 462 U.

But its opinion gives\nno strong basis for believing that this is the case.7 A 14\u00ad\nday break in custody does not eliminate the rationale for\nthe initial Edwards rule: The detainee has been told that\nhe may remain silent and speak only through a lawyer\nand that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be pro\u00ad\nvided for him. He has asked for a lawyer. He does not\nhave one. He is in custody. And police are still question\u00ad\ning him. A 14-day break in custody does not change the\nfact that custodial interrogation is inherently compelling.\nIt is unlikely to change the fact that a detainee \u201cconsiders\nhimself unable to deal with the pressures of custodial\ninterrogation without legal assistance.\u201d Roberson, 486\nU. S., at 683.8 And in some instances, a 14-day break in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See  Roberson, 486 U. S., at 681 (\u201c[I]f a suspect believes that he is not\ncapable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then\nit is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the au\u00ad\nthorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the\nproduct of the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 \u201d); Michigan v. Mosley,\n423 U. S. 96, 110, n. 2 (1975) (White, J., concurring in result) (\u201c[T]he\naccused having expressed his own view that he is not competent to deal\nwith the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the au\u00ad\nthorities\u2019 insistence to make a statement without counsel\u2019s presence\nmay properly be viewed with skepticism\u201d).\n   7 Today\u2019s decision, moreover, offers no reason for its 14-day time pe\u00ad\n\nriod. To be sure, it may be difficult to marshal conclusive evidence\nwhen setting an arbitrary time period. But in light of the basis for\nEdwards, we should tread carefully. Instead, the only reason for\nchoosing a 14-day time period, the Court tells us, is that \u201c[i]t seems to\nus that period is 14 days.\u201d Ante, at 11. That time period is \u201cplenty of\ntime for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult\nwith friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects\nof his prior custody.\u201d Ibid. But the Court gives no reason for that\nspeculation, which may well prove inaccurate in many circumstances.\n   8 In Roberson, for example, we observed that once a suspect has as\u00ad\n\f6                       MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncustody may make matters worse 9 \u201c[w]hen a suspect\nunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored\u201d\nand thus \u201cmay well see further objection as futile and\nconfession (true or not) as the only way to end his interro\u00ad\ngation.\u201d Davis, 512 U. S., at 472\u2013473 (Souter, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment).10\n  The Court ignores these understandings from the Ed\nwards line of cases and instead speculates that if a suspect\nis reinterrogated and eventually talks, it must be that\n\u201cfurther deliberation in familiar surroundings has caused\nhim to believe (rightly or wrongly) that cooperating with\nthe investigation is in his interest.\u201d Ante, at 9. But it is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nserted his right to an attorney, courts must presume he does \u201cnot feel\nsufficiently comfortable with the pressures of custodial interrogation to\nanswer questions without an attorney. This discomfort is precisely the\nstate of mind that Edwards presumes to persist . . . .\u201d 486 U. S., at 684.\nWe held in Roberson that just because different police come to speak\nabout a different investigation, that presumption does not change:\n\u201c[T]here is no reason to assume that a suspect\u2019s state of mind is in any\nway investigation-specific.\u201d Ibid. Nor is there any reason to believe\nthat it is arrest specific.\n    9 The compulsion is heightened by the fact that \u201c[t]he uncertainty of\n\nfate that being released from custody and then reapprehended entails\nis, in some circumstances, more coercive than continual custody.\u201d\nStrauss, Reinterrogation, 22 Hastings Const. L. Q. 359, 390 (1995).\n    10 Not only is this a likely effect of reinterrogation, but police may use\n\nthis effect to their advantage. Indeed, the Court\u2019s rule creates a\nstrange incentive to delay formal proceedings, in order to gain addi\u00ad\ntional information by way of interrogation after the time limit lapses.\nThe justification for Fifth Amendment rules \u201cmust be consistent with\n. . . practical realities,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at 688 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting), and the reality is that police may operate within the\nconfines of the Fifth Amendment in order to extract as many confes\u00ad\nsions as possible, see Leo & White, Adapting to Miranda: Modern\nInterrogators\u2019 Strategies for Dealing with the Obstacles Posed by\nMiranda, 84 Minn. L. Rev. 397 (1999). With a time limit as short as 14\ndays, police who hope that they can eventually extract a confession may\nfeel comfortable releasing a suspect for a short period of time. The\nresulting delay will only increase the compelling pressures on the\nsuspect.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnot apparent why that is the case. The answer, we are\ntold, is that once a suspect has been out of Miranda cus\u00ad\ntody for 14 days, \u201c[h]e has likely been able to seek advice\nfrom an attorney, family members, and friends.\u201d Ante, at\n8. This speculation, however, is overconfident and only\nquestionably relevant. As a factual matter, we do not\nknow whether the defendant has been able to seek advice:\nFirst of all, suspects are told that if they cannot afford a\nlawyer, one will be provided for them. Yet under the\nmajority\u2019s rule, an indigent suspect who took the police at\ntheir word when he asked for a lawyer will nonetheless be\nassumed to have \u201cbeen able to seek advice from an attor\u00ad\nney.\u201d Second, even suspects who are not indigent cannot\nnecessarily access legal advice (or social advice as the\nCourt presumes) within 14 days. Third, suspects may not\nrealize that they need to seek advice from an attorney.\nUnless police warn suspects that the interrogation will\nresume in 14 days, why contact a lawyer? When a suspect\nis let go, he may assume that the police were satisfied. In\nany event, it is not apparent why interim advice matters.11\nIn Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 153 (1990), we\nheld that it is not sufficient that a detainee happened to\nspeak at some point with a lawyer. See ibid. (noting that\n\u201cconsultation with an attorney\u201d does not prevent \u201cpersis\u00ad\ntent attempts by officials to persuade [a suspect] to waive\nhis rights\u201d or shield against the \u201ccoercive pressures that\naccompany custody\u201d). If the actual interim advice of an\nattorney is not sufficient, the hypothetical, interim advice\nof \u201can attorney, family members, and friends,\u201d ante, at 8,\nis not enough.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 It is important to distinguish this from the point that I make above\n\nabout indigent suspects. If the police promise to provide a lawyer and\nnever do so, it sends a message to the suspect that the police have lied\nand that the rights read to him are hollow. But the mere fact that a\nsuspect consulted a lawyer does not itself reduce the compulsion when\npolice reinterrogate him.\n\f8                      MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The many problems with the Court\u2019s new rule are exac\u00ad\nerbated in the very situation in this case: a suspect who is\nin prison. Even if, as the Court assumes, a trip to one\u2019s\nhome significantly changes the Edwards calculus, a trip to\none\u2019s prison cell is not the same. A prisoner\u2019s freedom is\nseverely limited, and his entire life remains subject to\ngovernment control. Such an environment is not condu\u00ad\ncive to \u201cshak[ing] off any residual coercive effects of his\nprior custody.\u201d Ante, at 11.12 Nor can a prisoner easily\n\u201cseek advice from an attorney, family members, and\nfriends,\u201d ante, at 8, especially not within 14 days; prison\u00ad\ners are frequently subject to restrictions on communica\u00ad\ntions. Nor, in most cases, can he live comfortably knowing\nthat he cannot be badgered by police; prison is not like a\nnormal situation in which a suspect \u201cis in control, and\nneed only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badg\u00ad\nering.\u201d Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 16). Indeed, for a person whose every move is\ncontrolled by the State, it is likely that \u201chis sense of de\u00ad\npendence on, and trust in, counsel as the guardian of his\ninterests in dealing with government officials intensified.\u201d\nUnited States v. Green, 592 A. 2d 985, 989 (D. C. 1991); cf.\nMinnick, 498 U. S., at 153 (explaining that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged\u201d).13 The Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 Cf. Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 326 (1969) (holding that a sus\u00ad\n\npect was in custody while being held in own home, despite his comfort\nand familiarity with the surroundings); Mathis v. United States, 391\nU. S. 1, 5 (1968) (holding that a person serving a prison sentence for\none crime was in custody when he was interrogated in prison about\nanother, unrelated crime); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 478\n(1966) (\u201c[W]hen an individual is . . . deprived of his freedom by the\nauthorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the\nprivilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized\u201d).\n   13 Prison also presents a troubling set of incentives for police. First,\n\nbecause investigators know that their suspect is also a prisoner, there\nis no need formally to place him under arrest. Thus, police generally\ncan interview prisoners even without probable cause to hold them.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nignores these realities of prison, and instead rests its\nargument on the supposition that a prisoner\u2019s \u201cdetention\n. . . is relatively disconnected from their prior unwilling\u00ad\nness to cooperate in an investigation.\u201d Ante, at 14. But\nthat is not necessarily the case. Prisoners are uniquely\nvulnerable to the officials who control every aspect of their\nlives; prison guards may not look kindly upon a prisoner\nwho refuses to cooperate with police. And cooperation\nfrequently is relevant to whether the prisoner can obtain\nparole. See, e.g., Code of Md. Regs., tit. 12, \u00a708.01.18(A)(3)\n(2008). Moreover, even if it is true as a factual matter\nthat a prisoner\u2019s fate is not controlled by the police who\ncome to interrogate him, how is the prisoner supposed to\nknow that? As the Court itself admits, compulsion is\nlikely when a suspect\u2019s \u201ccaptors appear to control [his]\nfate,\u201d ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nwhen a guard informs a suspect that he must go speak\nwith police, it will \u201cappear\u201d to the prisoner that the guard\nand police are not independent. \u201cQuestioning by captors,\nwho appear to control the suspect\u2019s fate, may create mutu\u00ad\nally reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will\nweaken the suspect\u2019s will.\u201d Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S.\n292, 297 (1990) (emphasis added).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis means that police can interrogate suspects with little or no evi\u00ad\ndence of guilt, and police can do so time after time, without fear of\nbeing sued for wrongful arrest. Second, because police know that their\nsuspect is otherwise detained, there is no need necessarily to resolve\nthe case quickly. Police can comfortably bide their time, interrogating\nand reinterrogating their suspect until he slips up. Third, because\npolice need not hold their suspect, they do not need to arraign him or\notherwise initiate formal legal proceedings that would trigger various\nprotections.\n   14 The Court attempts to distinguish detention in prison from the\n\n\u201cparadigm Edwards case,\u201d ante, at 7, but it is not clear why that is so.\nThe difference cannot be simply that convicted prisoners\u2019 \u201cdetention . . .\nis relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in\nan investigation,\u201d ante, at 14, because in many instances of pretrial\n\f10                     MARYLAND v. SHATZER \n\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                             III \n\n  Because, at the very least, we do not know whether\nShatzer could obtain a lawyer, and thus would have felt\nthat police had lied about providing one, I cannot join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. I concur in today\u2019s judgment, however, on\nanother ground: Even if Shatzer could not consult a law\u00ad\nyer and the police never provided him one, the 2\u00bd-year\nbreak in custody is a basis for treating the second interro\u00ad\ngation as no more coercive than the first. Neither a break\nin custody nor the passage of time has an inherent, cura\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncustody, the custody will continue regardless of whether a detainee\nanswers questions. Take Roberson for example. Roberson was arrested\nand being held for one crime when, days later, a different officer inter\u00ad\nrogated him about a different crime. 486 U. S., at 678. Regardless of\nwhether he cooperated with the second investigation, he was still being\nheld for the first crime. Yet under the Court\u2019s analysis, had Roberson\nbeen held long enough that he had become \u201caccustomed\u201d to the deten\u00ad\ntion facility, ante, at 14, there would have been a break in custody\nbetween each interrogation. Thus, despite the fact that coercive pres\u00ad\nsures \u201cmay increase as custody is prolonged,\u201d Minnick, 498 U. S., at\n153, the real problem in Roberson may have been that the police did not\nleave him sitting in jail for long enough.\n   This problem of pretrial custody also highlights a tension with the\nCourt\u2019s decision last Term in Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___\n(2009). In Montejo, the Court overturned Michigan v. Jackson, 475\nU. S. 625, 636 (1986), which had protected an accused\u2019s Sixth Amend\u00ad\nment right to counsel by \u201cforbidding police to initiate interrogation of a\ncriminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or\nsimilar proceeding.\u201d 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). In so doing, the\nCourt emphasized that because the Edwards \u201cregime suffices to protect\nthe integrity of \u2018a suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his\nlawyer\u2019s presence,\u2019 before his arraignment, it is hard to see why it\nwould not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment.\u201d\n556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162,\n175 (2001) (KENNEDY, J., concurring); citation omitted). But typically,\nafter arraignment, defendants are released on bail or placed in deten\u00ad\ntion facilities, both of which, according to the majority\u2019s logic, some\u00ad\ntimes constitute breaks in custody. How then, under the Court\u2019s\ndecision today, will Edwards serve the role that the Court placed on it\nin Montejo?\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

An\nindigent suspect who took police at their word that they\nwould provide an attorney probably will feel that he has\n\u201cbeen denied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d\nRoberson, 486 U. S., at 686, when police begin to question\nhim, without a lawyer, only 14 days later.15 But, when a\nsuspect has been left alone for a significant period of time,\nhe is not as likely to draw such conclusions when the\npolice interrogate him again.16 It is concededly \u201cimpossi\u00ad\nble to determine with precision\u201d where to draw such a line.\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 521 (1972). In the case\nbefore us, however, the suspect was returned to the gen\u00ad\neral prison population for 2\u00bd years. I am convinced that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 The Court responds that \u201c[i]f confidence in the police\u2019s promise to\n\nprovide counsel were the touchstone, Edwards would not have applied\nin Minnick, where the suspect in continuing custody actually met with\nappointed counsel.\u201d Ante, at 17\u201318. But my view is not that \u201cconfi\u00ad\ndence in the police\u2019s promise to provide counsel\u201d is \u201cthe touchtone.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. Rather, my view is that although an appropriate break in\ncustody will mitigate many of the reasons that custodial reinterrogation\nof a suspect who requested counsel is inherently compelling, it will not\nmitigate the effect of an indigent detainee believing that he has \u201cbeen\ndenied the counsel he has clearly requested,\u201d Roberson, 486 U. S., at\n686. If police tell an indigent suspect that he is not required to speak\nwithout an attorney, and that they will provide him with an attorney,\nand that suspect asserts his right to an attorney, but police nonetheless\ndo not provide an attorney and reinterrogate him (even if there was a\nbreak in custody between the interrogations), the indigent suspect is\nlikely to feel that the police lied to him or are ignoring his rights. This\nview is not in tension with Minnick. Minnick holds only that consulta\u00ad\ntion with an attorney between interrogations is not sufficient to end the\nEdwards presumption and therefore that when there has been no break\nin custody, \u201ccounsel\u2019s presence at interrogation,\u201d 498 U. S., at 152, is\nnecessary to address the compulsion with which the Edwards line of\ncases is concerned.\n    16 I do not doubt that some of the compulsion caused by reinterrogat\u00ad\n\ning an indigent suspect without providing a lawyer may survive even a\nbreak in custody and a very long passage of time. The relevant point\nhere is more limited: A long break in time, far longer than 14 days,\ndiminishes, rather than eliminates, that compulsion.\n\f12                MARYLAND v. SHATZER\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthis period of time is sufficient. I therefore concur in the\njudgment.\n\f"}

Argued November 10, 2009\u2013\u2013Decided February 23, 2010\nRespondents, California citizens, sued petitioner Hertz Corporation in a\n  California state court for claimed state-law violations. Hertz sought\n  removal to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2),\n  1441(a), claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of dif\n  ferent States, \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1), the federal court possessed diver\n  sity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Respondents, however, claimed that\n  Hertz was a California citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, di\n  versity jurisdiction was lacking under \u00a71332(c)(1), which provides\n  that \u201ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by\n  which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its prin\n  cipal place of business.\u201d To show that its \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\n  was in New Jersey, not California, Hertz submitted a declaration\n  stating, among other things, that it operated facilities in 44 States,\n  that California accounted for only a portion of its business activity,\n  that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in New Jersey,\n  and that its core executive and administrative functions are primar\n  ily carried out there. The District Court concluded that it lacked di\n  versity jurisdiction because Hertz was a California citizen under\n  Ninth Circuit precedent, which asks, inter alia, whether the amount\n  of the corporation\u2019s business activity is \u201csignificantly larger\u201d or \u201csub\n  stantially predominates\u201d in one State. Finding that California was\n  Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d under that test because a plural\n  ity of the relevant business activity occurred there, the District Court\n  remanded the case to state court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents\u2019 argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction under\n \u00a71453(c)\u2014which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as\n the District Court\u2019s only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d not to the Supreme\n\f2                        HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court, and provides that if \u201ca final judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court\n    of appeals \u201cis not issued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible\n    10-day extension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied\u201d\u2014makes far too much\n    of too little. The Court normally does not read statutory silence as\n    implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute\n    specifically grants. E.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 660\u2013661.\n    Here, replicating similar, older statutes, \u00a71254 specifically gives the\n    Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . . [b]y writ of certiorari\u201d cases that\n    are \u201cin the courts of appeals\u201d when it grants the writ. The Court thus\n    interprets \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as simply requiring a\n    court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time\u2014not to\n    deprive this Court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See,\n    e.g., Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466\u2013467.\n    Pp. 4\u20135.\n       2. The phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d in \u00a71332(c)(1) refers to\n    the place where a corporation\u2019s high level officers direct, control, and\n    coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities, i.e., its \u201cnerve center,\u201d which\n    will typically be found at its corporate headquarters. Pp. 5\u201319.\n          (a) A brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdic\n    tion demonstrates that Congress added \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\n    of business\u201d language to the traditional state-of-incorporation test in\n    order to prevent corporations from manipulating federal-court juris\n    diction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases. Pp. 5\u201310.\n          (b) However, the phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d has proved\n    more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected. After\n    Congress\u2019 amendment, courts were uncertain as to where to look to\n    determine a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d for diversity\n    purposes. If a corporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were\n    in the same State in which it did most of its business, the test seemed\n    straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in that State.\n    But if those corporate headquarters, including executive offices, were\n    in one State, while the corporation\u2019s plants or other centers of busi\n    ness activity were located in other States, the answer was less obvi\n    ous. Under these circumstances, for corporations with \u201cfar-flung\u201d\n    business activities, numerous Circuits have looked to a corporation\u2019s\n    \u201cnerve center,\u201d from which the corporation radiates out to its con\n    stituent parts and from which its officers direct, control, and coordi\n    nate the corporation\u2019s activities. However, this test did not go far\n    enough, for it did not answer what courts should do when a corpora\n    tion\u2019s operations are not far-flung but rather limited to only a few\n    States. When faced with this question, various courts have focused\n    more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s actual business activities are\n    located, adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to inter\n    pret the statute.

In practice it should normally be the place\nwhere the corporation maintains its headquarters\u2014provided that the\nheadquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordina\ntion, i.e., the \u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpo\nration holds its board meetings. Pp. 13\u201319.\n        (i) Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince the\nCourt that the \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, while imperfect, is superior\nto other possibilities. First, \u00a71332(c)(1)\u2019s language supports the ap\nproach. The statute\u2019s word \u201cplace\u201d is singular, not plural. Its word\n\u201cprincipal\u201d requires that the main, prominent, or most important\nplace be chosen. Cf., e.g., Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S. 168,\n174. And the fact that the word \u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState\nwhere\u201d means that the \u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State, not the State\nitself. A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main headquarters,\nis a single place. The public often considers it the corporation\u2019s main\nplace of business. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\napplication of a more general business activities test has led some\ncourts, as in the present case, to look, not at a particular place within\na State, but incorrectly at the State itself, measuring the total\namount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and\ndetermining whether they are significantly larger than in the next\nranking State. Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in\na jurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375. A \u201cnerve\ncenter\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates that \u201ccenter\u201d with a cor\nporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple to apply comparatively speaking.\nBy contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activities more often\nlack a single principal place where they take place. Third, the stat\nute\u2019s legislative history suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than an ear\nlier, numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical\nto apply. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test offers such a possibility. A general\nbusiness activities test does not.

S. C. \u00a71332(c)(1)\n(emphasis added). We seek here to resolve different inter\npretations that the Circuits have given this phrase. In\ndoing so, we place primary weight upon the need for judi\ncial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as\nsimple as possible. And we conclude that the phrase\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d refers to the place where the\ncorporation\u2019s high level officers direct, control, and coordi\nnate the corporation\u2019s activities. Lower federal courts\nhave often metaphorically called that place the corpora\ntion\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d See, e.g., Wisconsin Knife Works v.\nNational Metal Crafters, 781 F. 2d 1280, 1282 (CA7 1986);\nScot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., 170 F. Supp. 862,\n865 (SDNY 1959) (Weinfeld, J.). We believe that the\n\u201cnerve center\u201d will typically be found at a corporation\u2019s\nheadquarters.\n\f2                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   In September 2007, respondents Melinda Friend and\nJohn Nhieu, two California citizens, sued petitioner, the\nHertz Corporation, in a California state court. They\nsought damages for what they claimed were violations of\nCalifornia\u2019s wage and hour laws. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20a. And they requested relief on behalf of a potential\nclass composed of California citizens who had allegedly\nsuffered similar harms.\n   Hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), 1441(a). Hertz claimed that the\nplaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different\nStates. \u00a7\u00a71332(a)(1), (c)(1). Hence, the federal court\npossessed diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Friend and\nNhieu, however, claimed that the Hertz Corporation was a\nCalifornia citizen, like themselves, and that, hence, diver\nsity jurisdiction was lacking.\n   To support its position, Hertz submitted a declaration\nby an employee relations manager that sought to show\nthat Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was in New\nJersey, not in California. The declaration stated, among\nother things, that Hertz operated facilities in 44 States;\nand that California\u2014which had about 12% of the Nation\u2019s\npopulation, Pet. for Cert. 8\u2014accounted for 273 of Hertz\u2019s\n1,606 car rental locations; about 2,300 of its 11,230 full\ntime employees; about $811 million of its $4.371 billion in\nannual revenue; and about 3.8 million of its approximately\n21 million annual transactions, i.e., rentals. The declara\ntion also stated that the \u201cleadership of Hertz and its do\nmestic subsidiaries\u201d is located at Hertz\u2019s \u201ccorporate head\nquarters\u201d in Park Ridge, New Jersey; that its \u201ccore\nexecutive and administrative functions . . . are carried out\u201d\nthere and \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d in Oklahoma City, Okla\nhoma; and that its \u201cmajor administrative operations . . .\nare found\u201d at those two locations.

S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The District Court of the Northern District of California\naccepted Hertz\u2019s statement of the facts as undisputed.\nBut it concluded that, given those facts, Hertz was a citi\nzen of California. In reaching this conclusion, the court\napplied Ninth Circuit precedent, which instructs courts to\nidentify a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d by\nfirst determining the amount of a corporation\u2019s business\nactivity State by State. If the amount of activity is \u201csig\nnificantly larger\u201d or \u201csubstantially predominates\u201d in one\nState, then that State is the corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place\nof business.\u201d If there is no such State, then the \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d is the corporation\u2019s \u201c \u2018nerve center,\u2019 \u201d i.e.,\nthe place where \u201c \u2018the majority of its executive and admin\nistrative functions are performed.\u2019 \u201d Friend v. Hertz, No.\nC\u201307\u20135222 MMC (ND Cal., Jan. 15, 2008), p. 3 (hereinaf\nter Order); Tosco Corp. v. Communities for a Better Envi\nronment, 236 F. 3d 495, 500\u2013502 (CA9 2001) (per curiam).\n   Applying this test, the District Court found that the\n\u201cplurality of each of the relevant business activities\u201d was\nin California, and that \u201cthe differential between the\namount of those activities\u201d in California and the amount\nin \u201cthe next closest state\u201d was \u201csignificant.\u201d Order 4.\nHence, Hertz\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d was Califor\nnia, and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking. The\nDistrict Court consequently remanded the case to the\nstate courts.\n   Hertz appealed the District Court\u2019s remand order. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71453(c). The Ninth Circuit affirmed in a brief\nmemorandum opinion. 297 Fed. Appx. 690 (2008). Hertz\nfiled a petition for certiorari. And, in light of differences\namong the Circuits in the application of the test for corpo\nrate citizenship, we granted the writ. Compare Tosco\nCorp., supra, at 500\u2013502, and Capitol Indemnity Corp. v.\nRussellville Steel Co., 367 F. 3d 831, 836 (CA8 2004) (ap\nplying \u201ctotal activity\u201d test and looking at \u201call corporate\nactivities\u201d), with Wisconsin Knife Works, supra, at 1282\n\f4                   HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(applying \u201cnerve center\u201d test).\n                               II\n   At the outset, we consider a jurisdictional objection.\nRespondents point out that the statute permitting Hertz\nto appeal the District Court\u2019s remand order to the Court of\nAppeals, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71453(c), constitutes an exception to a\nmore general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are\n\u201cnot reviewable on appeal.\u201d \u00a71447(d). They add that the\nlanguage of \u00a71453(c) refers only to \u201ccourt[s] of appeals,\u201d\nnot to the Supreme Court. The statute also says that if \u201ca\nfinal judgment on the appeal\u201d in a court of appeals \u201cis not\nissued before the end\u201d of 60 days (with a possible 10-day\nextension), \u201cthe appeal shall be denied.\u201d And respondents\ndraw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion\nthat Congress intended to permit review of a remand\norder only by a court of appeals, not by the Supreme Court\n(at least not if, as here, this Court\u2019s grant of certiorari\ncomes after \u00a71453(c)\u2019s time period has elapsed).\n   This argument, however, makes far too much of too\nlittle. We normally do not read statutory silence as implic\nitly modifying or limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction that\nanother statute specifically grants. Felker v. Turpin, 518\nU. S. 651, 660\u2013661 (1996); Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85,\n104\u2013105 (1869). Here, another, pre-existing federal stat\nute gives this Court jurisdiction to \u201crevie[w] . . . [b]y writ\nof certiorari\u201d cases that, like this case, are \u201cin the courts of\nappeals\u201d when we grant the writ. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71254. This\nstatutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants\nthat yet older statutes provided. See, e.g., \u00a71254, 62 Stat.\n928; \u00a71, 43 Stat. 938\u2013939 (amending \u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157);\n\u00a7240, 36 Stat. 1157; Evarts Act, \u00a76, 26 Stat. 828. This\nhistory provides particularly strong reasons not to read\n\u00a71453(c)\u2019s silence or ambiguous language as modifying or\nlimiting our pre-existing jurisdiction.\n    We thus interpret \u00a71453(c)\u2019s \u201c60-day\u201d requirement as\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision\nwithin a specified time\u2014not to deprive this Court of sub\nsequent jurisdiction to review the case. See Aetna Casu\nalty & Surety Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 466\u2013467\n(1947); Gay v. Ruff, 292 U. S. 25, 28\u201331 (1934).\n                              III\n   We begin our \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d discussion\nwith a brief review of relevant history. The Constitution\nprovides that the \u201cjudicial Power shall extend\u201d to \u201cContro\nversies . . . between Citizens of different States.\u201d Art. III,\n\u00a72. This language, however, does not automatically confer\ndiversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. Rather, it\nauthorizes Congress to do so and, in doing so, to determine\nthe scope of the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction within constitu\ntional limits. Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226,\n233\u2013234 (1922); Mayor v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 252 (1868).\n   Congress first authorized federal courts to exercise\ndiversity jurisdiction in 1789 when, in the First Judiciary\nAct, Congress granted federal courts authority to hear\nsuits \u201cbetween a citizen of the State where the suit is\nbrought, and a citizen of another State.\u201d \u00a711, 1 Stat. 78.\nThe statute said nothing about corporations. In 1809,\nChief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court,\ndescribed a corporation as an \u201cinvisible, intangible, and\nartificial being\u201d which was \u201ccertainly not a citizen.\u201d Bank\nof United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809). But\nthe Court held that a corporation could invoke the federal\ncourts\u2019 diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the\ncorporation\u2019s shareholders were all citizens of a different\nState from the defendants, as \u201cthe term citizen ought to be\nunderstood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is\nused in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons\nwho come into court, in this case, under their corporate\nname.\u201d Id., at 91\u201392.\n   In Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497\n\f6                  HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1844), the Court modified this initial approach. It held\nthat a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of\nthe State by which it had been created, and its citizenship\nfor jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly. Id., at\n558\u2013559. Ten years later, the Court in Marshall v. Balti\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314 (1854), held that the\nreason a corporation was a citizen of its State of incorpora\ntion was that, for the limited purpose of determining\ncorporate citizenship, courts could conclusively (and artifi\ncially) presume that a corporation\u2019s shareholders were\ncitizens of the State of incorporation. Id., at 327\u2013328.\nAnd it reaffirmed Letson. 16 How., at 325\u2013326. Whatever\nthe rationale, the practical upshot was that, for diversity\npurposes, the federal courts considered a corporation to be\na citizen of the State of its incorporation. 13F C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a73623, pp. 1\u20137 (3d ed. 2009) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\n   In 1928 this Court made clear that the \u201cstate of incorpo\nration\u201d rule was virtually absolute. It held that a corpora\ntion closely identified with State A could proceed in a\nfederal court located in that State as long as the corpora\ntion had filed its incorporation papers in State B, perhaps\na State where the corporation did no business at all. See\nBlack and White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown and\nYellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276 U. S. 518, 522\u2013525\n(refusing to question corporation\u2019s reincorporation motives\nand finding diversity jurisdiction). Subsequently, many in\nCongress and those who testified before it pointed out that\nthis interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction\u2019s\nbasic rationale, namely, opening the federal courts\u2019 doors\nto those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice\nagainst out-of-state parties. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 530, 72d\nCong., 1st Sess., 2, 4\u20137 (1932). Through its choice of the\nState of incorporation, a corporation could manipulate\nfederal-court jurisdiction, for example, opening the federal\ncourts\u2019 doors in a State where it conducted nearly all its\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness by filing incorporation papers elsewhere. Id., at\n4 (\u201cSince the Supreme Court has decided that a corpora\ntion is a citizen . . . it has become a common practice for\ncorporations to be incorporated in one State while they do\nbusiness in another. And there is no doubt but that it\noften occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have\nthe advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of\nlitigation\u201d). See also Hearings on S. 937 et al. before a\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n72d Cong., 1st Sess., 4\u20135 (1932) (Letter from Sen. George\nW. Norris to Attorney General William D. Mitchell (May\n24, 1930)) (citing a \u201ccommon practice for individuals to\nincorporate in a foreign State simply for the purpose of\ntaking litigation which may arise into the Federal courts\u201d).\nAlthough various legislative proposals to curtail the corpo\nrate use of diversity jurisdiction were made, see, e.g.,\nS. 937, S. 939, H. R. 11508, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. (1932),\nnone of these proposals were enacted into law.\n   At the same time as federal dockets increased in size,\nmany judges began to believe those dockets contained too\nmany diversity cases. A committee of the Judicial Confer\nence of the United States studied the matter. See Reports\nof the Proceedings of the Regular Annual Meeting and\nSpecial Meeting (Sept. 24\u201326 & Mar. 19\u201320, 1951), in\nH. R. Doc. No. 365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 26\u201327 (1952).\nAnd on March 12, 1951, that committee, the Committee on\nJurisdiction and Venue, issued a report (hereinafter Mar.\nCommittee Rept.).\n   Among its observations, the committee found a general\nneed \u201cto prevent frauds and abuses\u201d with respect to juris\ndiction. Id., at 14. The committee recommended against\neliminating diversity cases altogether. Id., at 28. Instead\nit recommended, along with other proposals, a statutory\namendment that would make a corporation a citizen both\nof the State of its incorporation and any State from which\nit received more than half of its gross income. Id., at 14\u2013\n\f8                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15 (requiring corporation to show that \u201cless than fifty per\ncent of its gross income was derived from business trans\nacted within the state where the Federal court is held\u201d).\nIf, for example, a citizen of California sued (under state\nlaw in state court) a corporation that received half or more\nof its gross income from California, that corporation would\nnot be able to remove the case to federal court, even if\nDelaware was its State of incorporation.\n   During the spring and summer of 1951 committee mem\nbers circulated their report and attended circuit confer\nences at which federal judges discussed the report\u2019s rec\nommendations. Reflecting those criticisms, the committee\nfiled a new report in September, in which it revised its\ncorporate citizenship recommendation.

In respect to the \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d proposal, he said that the relevant language\n\u201cha[d] been defined in the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d House Hear\nings 37. He added:\n    \u201cAll of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy\n    cases, and as I recall the cases\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t want\n    to be bound by this statement because I haven\u2019t them\n    before me\u2014I think the courts have generally taken\n    the view that where a corporation\u2019s interests are\n    rather widespread, the principal place of business is\n    an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one. It is\n    the actual place where its business operations are co\n    ordinated, directed, and carried out, which would or\n    dinarily be the place where its officers carry on its\n    day-to-day business, where its accounts are kept,\n    where its payments are made, and not necessarily a\n    State in which it may have a plant, if it is a big corpo\n    ration, or something of that sort.\n      \u201cBut that has been pretty well worked out in the\n    bankruptcy cases, and that law would all be available,\n    you see, to be applied here without having to go over it\n    again from the beginning.\u201d Ibid.\nThe House Committee reprinted the Judicial Conference\nCommittee Reports along with other reports and relevant\ntestimony and circulated it to the general public \u201cfor the\npurpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.\u201d\nId., at III.

Dillon, 144 F. 737, 738 (CA1\n1906) (holding that a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal office, rather\nthan a factory, mill, or mine . . . constitutes the \u2018principal\nplace of business\u2019 \u201d), with Continental Coal Corp. v.\nRoszelle Bros., 242 F. 243, 247 (CA6 1917) (identifying the\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d as the location of mining\nactivities, rather than the \u201cprincipal office\u201d); see also\nFriedenthal, New Limitations on Federal Jurisdiction, 11\nStan. L. Rev. 213, 223 (1959) (\u201cThe cases under the Bank\nruptcy Act provide no rigid legal formula for the determi\nnation of the principal place of business\u201d).\n   After Congress\u2019 amendment, courts were similarly\nuncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation\u2019s\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d for diversity purposes. If a\ncorporation\u2019s headquarters and executive offices were in\nthe same State in which it did most of its business, the\ntest seemed straightforward. The \u201cprincipal place of\nbusiness\u201d was located in that State. See, e.g., Long v.\nSilver, 248 F. 3d 309, 314\u2013315 (CA4 2001); Pinnacle Con\nsultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia Nat. Corp., 101 F. 3d 900, 906\u2013\n907 (CA2 1996).\n   But suppose those corporate headquarters, including\nexecutive offices, are in one State, while the corporation\u2019s\nplants or other centers of business activity are located in\nother States? In 1959 a distinguished federal district\njudge, Edward Weinfeld, relied on the Second Circuit\u2019s\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The test applied by our Court\n    of Appeals, is that place where the corporation has an\n    \u2018office from which its business was directed and con\n    trolled\u2019\u2014the place where \u2018all of its business was under\n    the supreme direction and control of its officers.\u2019 \u201d\n    Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at 865.\nNumerous Circuits have since followed this rule, applying\nthe \u201cnerve center\u201d test for corporations with \u201cfar-flung\u201d\nbusiness activities. See, e.g., Topp v. Compair Inc., 814\nF. 2d 830, 834 (CA1 1987); see also 15 J.

For it\ndid not answer what courts should do when the operations\nof the corporation are not \u201cfar-flung\u201d but rather limited to\nonly a few States. When faced with this question, various\ncourts have focused more heavily on where a corporation\u2019s\nactual business activities are located. See, e.g., Diaz-\nRodriguez v. Pep Boys Corp., 410 F. 3d 56, 60\u201361 (CA1\n2005); R. G. Barry Corp. v.

FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts must decide which factors are more important than\nothers: for example, plant location, sales or servicing\ncenters; transactions, payrolls, or revenue generation.\nSee, e.g., R. G.

A major\ntreatise confirms this growing complexity, listing Circuit\nby Circuit, cases that highlight different factors or empha\nsize similar factors differently, and reporting that the\n\u201cfederal courts of appeals have employed various tests\u201d\u2014\ntests which \u201ctend to overlap\u201d and which are sometimes\ndescribed in \u201clanguage\u201d that \u201cis imprecise.\u201d 15 Moore\u2019s\n\u00a7102.54[2], at 102\u2013112.

Peck, 18 How. 595, 599\n(1856). But, if so, that task seems doomed to failure.\nAfter all, the relevant purposive concern\u2014prejudice\nagainst an out-of-state party\u2014will often depend upon\nfactors that courts cannot easily measure, for example, a\ncorporation\u2019s image, its history, and its advertising, while\nthe factors that courts can more easily measure, for exam\nple, its office or plant location, its sales, its employment, or\nthe nature of the goods or services it supplies, will some\ntimes bear no more than a distant relation to the likeli\nhood of prejudice. At the same time, this approach is at\nwar with administrative simplicity. And it has failed to\nachieve a nationally uniform interpretation of federal law,\nan unfortunate consequence in a federal legal system.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  In an effort to find a single, more uniform interpretation\nof the statutory phrase, we have reviewed the Courts of\nAppeals\u2019 divergent and increasingly complex interpreta\n\f14                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Having done so, we now return to, and expand,\nJudge Weinfeld\u2019s approach, as applied in the Seventh\nCircuit. See, e.g., Scot Typewriter Co., 170 F. Supp., at\n865; Wisconsin Knife Works, 781 F. 2d, at 1282. We con\nclude that \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is best read as\nreferring to the place where a corporation\u2019s officers direct,\ncontrol, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities. It is\nthe place that Courts of Appeals have called the corpora\ntion\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d And in practice it should normally\nbe the place where the corporation maintains its head\nquarters\u2014provided that the headquarters is the actual\ncenter of direction, control, and coordination, i.e., the\n\u201cnerve center,\u201d and not simply an office where the corpora\ntion holds its board meetings (for example, attended by\ndirectors and officers who have traveled there for the\noccasion).\n   Three sets of considerations, taken together, convince us\nthat this approach, while imperfect, is superior to other\npossibilities. First, the statute\u2019s language supports the\napproach. The statute\u2019s text deems a corporation a citizen\nof the \u201cState where it has its principal place of business. \u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)(1).           The word \u201cplace\u201d is\nin the singular, not the plural. The word \u201cprincipal\u201d re\nquires us to pick out the \u201cmain, prominent\u201d or \u201cleading\u201d\nplace. 12 Oxford English Dictionary 495 (2d ed. 1989)\n(def. (A)(I)(2)). Cf. Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U. S.\n168, 174 (1993) (interpreting \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d\nfor tax purposes to require an assessment of \u201cwhether any\none business location is the \u2018most important, consequen\ntial, or influential\u2019 one\u201d). And the fact that the word\n\u201cplace\u201d follows the words \u201cState where\u201d means that the\n\u201cplace\u201d is a place within a State. It is not the State itself.\n   A corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center,\u201d usually its main head\nquarters, is a single place. The public often (though not\nalways) considers it the corporation\u2019s main place of busi\nness. And it is a place within a State. By contrast, the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication of a more general business activities test has\nled some courts, as in the present case, to look, not at a\nparticular place within a State, but incorrectly at the\nState itself, measuring the total amount of business activi\nties that the corporation conducts there and determining\nwhether they are \u201csignificantly larger\u201d than in the next\nranking State. 297 Fed. Appx. 690.\n   This approach invites greater litigation and can lead to\nstrange results, as the Ninth Circuit has since recognized.\nNamely, if a \u201ccorporation may be deemed a citizen of\nCalifornia on th[e] basis\u201d of \u201cactivities [that] roughly\nreflect California\u2019s larger population . . . nearly every\nnational retailer\u2014no matter how far flung its operations\u2014\nwill be deemed a citizen of California for diversity pur\nposes.\u201d Davis v. HSBC Bank Nev., N. A., 557 F. 3d 1026,\n1029\u20131030 (2009). But why award or decline diversity\njurisdiction on the basis of a State\u2019s population, whether\nmeasured directly, indirectly (say proportionately), or with\nmodifications?\n   Second, administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a\njurisdictional statute. Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 375\n(1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (eschewing\n\u201cthe sort of vague boundary that is to be avoided in the\narea of subject-matter jurisdiction wherever possible\u201d).\nComplex jurisdictional tests complicate a case, eating up\ntime and money as the parties litigate, not the merits of\ntheir claims, but which court is the right court to decide\nthose claims. Cf. Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U. S.\n458, 464, n. 13 (1980). Complex tests produce appeals and\nreversals, encourage gamesmanship, and, again, diminish\nthe likelihood that results and settlements will reflect a\nclaim\u2019s legal and factual merits. Judicial resources too are\nat stake. Courts have an independent obligation to de\ntermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nwhen no party challenges it. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil\n\f16                HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCo., 526 U. S. 574, 583 (1999)). So courts benefit from\nstraightforward rules under which they can readily assure\nthemselves of their power to hear a case. Arbaugh, supra,\nat 514.\n   Simple jurisdictional rules also promote greater predict\nability. Predictability is valuable to corporations making\nbusiness and investment decisions. Cf. First Nat. City\nBank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462\nU. S. 611, 621 (1983) (recognizing the \u201cneed for certainty\nand predictability of result while generally protecting the\njustified expectations of parties with interests in the cor\nporation\u201d). Predictability also benefits plaintiffs deciding\nwhether to file suit in a state or federal court.\n   A \u201cnerve center\u201d approach, which ordinarily equates\nthat \u201ccenter\u201d with a corporation\u2019s headquarters, is simple\nto apply comparatively speaking. The metaphor of a cor\nporate \u201cbrain,\u201d while not precise, suggests a single loca\ntion. By contrast, a corporation\u2019s general business activi\nties more often lack a single principal place where they\ntake place. That is to say, the corporation may have sev\neral plants, many sales locations, and employees located in\nmany different places. If so, it will not be as easy to de\ntermine which of these different business locales is the\n\u201cprincipal\u201d or most important \u201cplace.\u201d\n   Third, the statute\u2019s legislative history, for those who\naccept it, offers a simplicity-related interpretive bench\nmark. The Judicial Conference provided an initial version\nof its proposal that suggested a numerical test. A corpora\ntion would be deemed a citizen of the State that accounted\nfor more than half of its gross income. Mar. Committee\nRept. 14\u201315; see supra, at 8. The Conference changed its\nmind in light of criticism that such a test would prove too\ncomplex and impractical to apply. Sept. Committee Rept.\n2; see also H. Rep. 1706, at 28; S. Rep. 1830, at 31. That\nhistory suggests that the words \u201cprincipal place of busi\nness\u201d should be interpreted to be no more complex than\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe initial \u201chalf of gross income\u201d test. A \u201cnerve center\u201d test\noffers such a possibility. A general business activities test\ndoes not.\n                                 B\n   We recognize that there may be no perfect test that\nsatisfies all administrative and purposive criteria. We\nrecognize as well that, under the \u201cnerve center\u201d test we\nadopt today, there will be hard cases. For example, in this\nera of telecommuting, some corporations may divide their\ncommand and coordinating functions among officers who\nwork at several different locations, perhaps communicat\ning over the Internet. That said, our test nonetheless\npoints courts in a single direction, towards the center of\noverall direction, control, and coordination. Courts do not\nhave to try to weigh corporate functions, assets, or reve\nnues different in kind, one from the other. Our approach\nprovides a sensible test that is relatively easier to apply,\nnot a test that will, in all instances, automatically gener\nate a result.\n   We also recognize that the use of a \u201cnerve center\u201d test\nmay in some cases produce results that seem to cut\nagainst the basic rationale for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, see su\npra, at 6. For example, if the bulk of a company\u2019s business\nactivities visible to the public take place in New Jersey,\nwhile its top officers direct those activities just across the\nriver in New York, the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d is New\nYork. One could argue that members of the public in New\nJersey would be less likely to be prejudiced against the\ncorporation than persons in New York\u2014yet the corpora\ntion will still be entitled to remove a New Jersey state case\nto federal court. And note too that the same corporation\nwould be unable to remove a New York state case to fed\neral court, despite the New York public\u2019s presumed preju\ndice against the corporation.\n   We understand that such seeming anomalies will arise.\n\f18                 HERTZ CORP. v. FRIEND\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHowever, in view of the necessity of having a clearer rule,\nwe must accept them. Accepting occasionally counterin\ntuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to\navoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while\nproducing the benefits that accompany a more uniform\nlegal system.\n   The burden of persuasion for establishing diversity\njurisdiction, of course, remains on the party asserting it.\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance\nCorp., 298 U. S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E Wright &\nMiller \u00a73602.1, at 119. When challenged on allegations of\njurisdictional facts, the parties must support their allega\ntions by competent proof. McNutt, supra, at 189; 15\nMoore\u2019s \u00a7102.14, at 102\u201332 to 102\u201332.1. And when faced\nwith such a challenge, we reject suggestions such as,\nfor example, the one made by petitioner that the mere\nfiling of a form like the Securities and Exchange Commis\nsion\u2019s Form 10\u2013K listing a corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal execu\ntive offices\u201d would, without more, be sufficient proof to\nestablish a corporation\u2019s \u201cnerve center.\u201d See, e.g., SEC\nForm 10\u2013K, online at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/\nform10-k.pdf. (as visited Feb. 19, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). Cf. Dimmitt & Owens Finan\ncial, Inc. v. United States, 787 F. 2d 1186, 1190\u20131192 (CA7\n1986) (distinguishing \u201cprincipal executive office\u201d in the tax\nlien context, see 26 U. S. C. \u00a76323(f)(2), from \u201cprincipal\nplace of business\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(c)). Such possi\nbilities would readily permit jurisdictional manipulation,\nthereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the\n\u201cprincipal place of business\u201d language in the diversity\nstatute. Indeed, if the record reveals attempts at manipu\nlation\u2014for example, that the alleged \u201cnerve center\u201d is\nnothing more than a mail drop box, a bare office with a\ncomputer, or the location of an annual executive retreat\u2014\nthe courts should instead take as the \u201cnerve center\u201d the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Because respondents should have a fair op-\nportunity to litigate their case in light of our holding,\nhowever, we vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\f"}

S. 436, 471, this\n  Court held that an individual must be \u201cclearly informed,\u201d prior to\n  custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to\n  consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n  rogation.\u201d\n    After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him,\n  Tampa Police read him their standard Miranda form, stating, inter\n  alia: \u201cYou have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of\n  our questions\u201d and \u201c[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at\n  any time you want during this interview.\u201d Powell then admitted he\n  owned a handgun found in a police search. He was charged with pos\n  session of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.\n  The trial court denied Powell\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory\n  statements, which was based on the contention that the Miranda\n  warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the pres\n  ence of an attorney during questioning. Powell was convicted of the\n  gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that\n  the trial court should have suppressed the statements. The Florida\n  Supreme Court agreed. It noted that both Miranda and the State\n  Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to\n  have a lawyer present during questioning. The advice Powell re\n  ceived was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that\n  he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to\n  question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsel\u2019s presence\n  throughout the interrogation.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case. Powell contends\n that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied\n on the State\u2019s Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision\n\f2                          FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rested on an adequate and independent state ground. See Coleman\n    v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n    1032, 1040\u20131041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears\n    to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,\n    and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground\n    is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that fed\n    eral law controlled the state court\u2019s decision. Although invoking Flor\n    ida\u2019s Constitution and precedent in addition to this Court\u2019s decisions,\n    the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave\n    Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\n    Miranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044. The state-court opinion con\n    sistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what\n    Florida law independently requires. This Court therefore cannot\n    identify, \u201cfrom the face of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the de\n    cision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See Long,\n    463 U. S., at 1041. Because the opinion does not \u201cindicat[e] clearly\n    and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate,\n    adequate, and independent [state] grounds,\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at 1041,\n    this Court has jurisdiction. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       2. Advice that a suspect has \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\n    answering any of [the law enforcement officers\u2019] questions,\u201d and that\n    he can invoke this right \u201cat any time . . . during th[e] interview,\u201d sat\n    isfies Miranda. Pp. 7\u201313.\n          (a) Miranda requires that a suspect \u201cbe warned prior to any\n    questioning . . . that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d\n    384 U. S., at 479. This Miranda warning addresses the Court\u2019s par\n    ticular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody in\n    terrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one\n    merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interro\n    gators.\u201d Id., at 469. Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as\n    \u201can absolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual held\n    for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has the right to\n    consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter\n    rogation.\u201d Id., at 471. While the warnings prescribed by Miranda\n    are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the es\n    sential information must be conveyed. See, e.g., California v. Pry\n    sock, 453 U. S. 355, 359. In determining whether police warnings\n    were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to \u201cexamine\n    [them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.\n    The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to\n    [a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth v.\n    Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203. Pp. 7\u20139.\n          (b) The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard.

And the statement that Powell had \u201cthe right to use any of\n  [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview\u201d con\n  firmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the inter\n  rogation was underway. In combination, the two warnings reasona\n  bly conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the\n  outset of interrogation, but at all times. To reach the opposite con\n  clusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the\n  interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive\n  and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be\n  obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each\n  query. Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclu\n  sion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language\n  that Powell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the offi\n  cers\u2019] questions\u201d suggested he could consult with an attorney only be\n  fore the interrogation started. In context, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely\n  conveyed that Powell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective before he\n  answered any questions at all. Nothing in the words used indicated\n  that counsel\u2019s presence would be restricted after the questioning\n  commenced. Powell suggests that today\u2019s holding will tempt law en\n  forcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings\n  to introduce ambiguity. But, as the Federal Government explains, it\n  is in law enforcement\u2019s own interest to state warnings with maxi\n  mum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the\n  advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspect\u2019s statement. The\n  standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are\n  admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise\n  formulation necessary to meet Miranda\u2019s requirements. Different\n  words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communi\n  cated the same message.

Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436, 471 (1966), the Court held that an individual\nmust be \u201cclearly informed,\u201d prior to custodial questioning,\nthat he has, among other rights, \u201cthe right to consult with\na lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interro\ngation.\u201d The question presented in this case is whether\nadvice that a suspect has \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer\nbefore answering any of [the law enforcement officers\u2019]\nquestions,\u201d and that he can invoke this right \u201cat any time\n. . . during th[e] interview,\u201d satisfies Miranda. We hold\nthat it does.\n                            I\n  On August 10, 2004, law enforcement officers in Tampa,\nFlorida, seeking to apprehend respondent Kevin Dewayne\nPowell in connection with a robbery investigation, entered\nan apartment rented by Powell\u2019s girlfriend. 969 So. 2d\n1060, 1063 (Fla. App. 2007). After spotting Powell coming\nfrom a bedroom, the officers searched the room and dis\ncovered a loaded nine-millimeter handgun under the bed.\nIbid.\n  The officers arrested Powell and transported him to the\n\f2                    FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nTampa Police headquarters. Ibid. Once there, and before\nasking Powell any questions, the officers read Powell the\nstandard Tampa Police Department Consent and Release\nForm 310. Id., at 1063\u20131064. The form states:\n    \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. If you give up\n    the right to remain silent, anything you say can be\n    used against you in court. You have the right to talk\n    to a lawyer before answering any of our questions. If\n    you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be ap\n    pointed for you without cost and before any question\n    ing. You have the right to use any of these rights at\n    any time you want during this interview.\u201d App. 3.\n    See also 969 So. 2d, at 1064.\n   Acknowledging that he had been informed of his rights,\nthat he \u201cunderst[oo]d them,\u201d and that he was \u201cwilling to\ntalk\u201d to the officers, Powell signed the form. App. 3. He\nthen admitted that he owned the handgun found in the\napartment. Powell knew he was prohibited from possess\ning a gun because he had previously been convicted of a\nfelony, but said he had nevertheless purchased and car\nried the firearm for his protection. See 969 So. 2d, at\n1064; App. 29.\n   Powell was charged in state court with possession of a\nweapon by a prohibited possessor, in violation of Fla. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a7790.23(1) (West 2007).          Contending that the\nMiranda warnings were deficient because they did not\nadequately convey his right to the presence of an attorney\nduring questioning, he moved to suppress his inculpatory\nstatements. The trial court denied the motion, concluding\nthat the officers had properly notified Powell of his right to\ncounsel. 969 So. 2d, at 1064; App. 28. A jury convicted\nPowell of the gun-possession charge. 969 So. 2d, at 1064.\n   On appeal, the Florida Second District Court of Appeal\nheld that the trial court should have suppressed Powell\u2019s\nstatements.

The court\nfound that the advice Powell received was misleading\nbecause it suggested that Powell could \u201conly consult with\nan attorney before questioning\u201d and did not convey Pow\nell\u2019s entitlement to counsel\u2019s presence throughout the\ninterrogation. Id., at 541.

POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Justice Wells dissented. He considered it \u201cunreasonable\nto conclude that the broad, unqualified language read to\nPowell would lead a person of ordinary intelligence to\nbelieve that he or she had a limited right to consult with\nan attorney that could only be exercised before answering\nthe first question posed by law enforcement.\u201d Id., at 544.\nThe final sentence of the warning, he stressed, \u201cavoid[ed]\nthe implication\u2014unreasonable as it may [have] be[en]\u2014\nthat advice concerning the right of access to counsel before\nquestioning conveys the message that access to counsel is\nforeclosed during questioning.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).       Criticizing the majority\u2019s \u201ctechnical\nadherence to language . . . that has no connection with\nwhether the person who confessed understood his or her\nrights,\u201d id., at 545, he concluded that \u201c[t]he totality of the\nwarning reasonably conveyed to Powell his continuing\nright of access to counsel,\u201d id., at 544.\n  We granted certiorari, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\nreverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n                             II\n   We first address Powell\u2019s contention that this Court\nlacks jurisdiction to hear this case because the Florida\nSupreme Court, by relying not only on Miranda but also\non the Florida Constitution, rested its decision on an\nadequate and independent state ground.

S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbarriers to a determination by this Court of the validity\nunder the federal constitution of state action.\u201d Ibid.\n  To that end, we announced, in Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983), the following presumption:\n     \u201c[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to\n     rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with\n     the federal law, and when the adequacy and inde\n     pendence of any possible state law ground is not clear\n     from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the\n     most reasonable explanation that the state court de\n     cided the case the way it did because it believed that\n     federal law required it to do so.\u201d\nAt the same time, we adopted a plain-statement rule to\navoid the presumption: \u201cIf the state court decision indi\ncates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on\nbona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds,\nwe, of course, will not undertake to review the decision.\u201d\nId., at 1041.2\n   Under the Long presumption, we have jurisdiction to\nentertain this case. Although invoking Florida\u2019s Constitu\ntion and precedent in addition to this Court\u2019s decisions,\nthe Florida Supreme Court treated state and federal law\nas interchangeable and interwoven; the court at no point\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Dissenting  in Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), JUSTICE\nSTEVENS did not urge, as he now does, inspection of state-court deci\nsions to count the number of citations to state and federal provisions\nand opinions, or heroic efforts to fathom what the state court really\nmeant. See post, at 3\u20137 (dissenting opinion). Instead, his preferred\napproach was as clear as the Court\u2019s. In lieu of \u201cpresuming that\nadequate state grounds are not independent unless it clearly appears\notherwise,\u201d he would have \u201cpresum[ed] that adequate state grounds are\nindependent unless it clearly appears otherwise.\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at\n1066; see post, at 2, n. 1. Either presumption would avoid arduous\nefforts to detect, case by case, whether a state ground of decision is\ntruly \u201cindependent of the [state court\u2019s] understanding of federal law.\u201d\nLong, 463 U. S., at 1066. Today, however, the dissent would require\nthis Court to engage in just that sort of inquiry.\n\f6                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexpressly asserted that state-law sources gave Powell\nrights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in\nMiranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044.\n   Beginning with the certified question\u2014whether the\nadvice the Tampa police gave to Powell \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (some capitalization omit\nted)\u2014and continuing throughout its opinion, the Florida\nSupreme Court trained on what Miranda demands, rather\nthan on what Florida law independently requires. See,\ne.g., 998 So. 2d, at 533 (\u201cThe issue before this Court is\nwhether the failure to provide express advice of the right\nto the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation\nviolates the principles espoused in Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436.\u201d); id., at 538 (\u201c[T]he issue of [what] Miranda\nrequires . . . has been addressed by several of the Florida\ndistrict courts of appeal.\u201d); id., at 542 (Powell received a\n\u201cnarrower and less functional warning than that required\nby Miranda.\u201d).3 We therefore cannot identify, \u201cfrom the\nface of the opinion,\u201d a clear statement that the decision\nrested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See\nLong, 463 U. S., at 1041 (the state court \u201cneed only make\nclear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that\nthe federal cases are being used only for the purpose of\nguidance, and do not themselves compel the result that\nthe court has reached\u201d).4 \u201cTo avoid misunderstanding, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that these statements refer to Miranda\n\nonly in a \u201cgeneric\u201d sense to mean \u201cthe warnings suspects must be given\nbefore interrogation.\u201d Post, at 6. This explanation fails to account for\nthe Florida Supreme Court\u2019s repeated citations to the opinion in\nMiranda. In context, it is obvious that the court was attempting to\nhome in on what that opinion\u2014which, of course, interpreted only the\nFederal Constitution and not Florida law\u2014requires. See, e.g., 998\nSo. 2d 531, 533, 534, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542 (2008).\n   4 JUSTICE STEVENS agrees that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\nis interwoven with federal law, post, at 7, and lacks the plain statement\ncontemplated by Long, post, at 3. Nevertheless, he finds it possible to\ndiscern an independent state-law basis for the decision. As Long makes\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

Nothing in our decision today, we\nemphasize, trenches on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\nauthority to impose, based on the State\u2019s Constitution, any\nadditional protections against coerced confessions it deems\nappropriate. But because the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision does not \u201cindicat[e] clearly and expressly that it is\nalternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and\nindependent [state] grounds,\u201d Long, 463 U. S., at 1041, we\nhave jurisdiction to decide this case.\n                           III \n\n                            A\n\n  To give force to the Constitution\u2019s protection against\ncompelled self-incrimination, the Court established in\nMiranda \u201ccertain procedural safeguards that require\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nclear, however, \u201cwhen . . . [the] state court decision fairly appears to . . .\nbe interwoven with . . . federal law,\u201d the only way to avoid the jurisdic\ntional presumption is to provide a plain statement expressing inde\npendent reliance on state law. 463 U. S., at 1040. It is this plain\nstatement that makes \u201cthe adequacy and independence of any possible\nstate law ground . . . clear from the face of the opinion.\u201d Id., at 1040\u2013\n1041. See also Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 44 (1996) (GINSBURG, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cLong governs even when, all things consid\nered, the more plausible reading of the state court\u2019s decision may be\nthat the state court did not regard the Federal Constitution alone as a\nsufficient basis for its ruling.\u201d).\n\f8                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolice to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing\ncustodial interrogation.\u201d Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.\n195, 201 (1989). Intent on \u201cgiv[ing] concrete constitutional\nguidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to\nfollow,\u201d 384 U. S., at 441\u2013442, Miranda prescribed the\nfollowing four now-familiar warnings:\n    \u201c[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning\n    [1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that any\n    thing he says can be used against him in a court of\n    law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an at\n    torney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney\n    one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning\n    if he so desires.\u201d Id., at 479.\n   Miranda\u2019s third warning\u2014the only one at issue here\u2014\naddresses our particular concern that \u201c[t]he circumstances\nsurrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very\nquickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of\nhis privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.\u201d Id.,\nat 469. Responsive to that concern, we stated, as \u201can\nabsolute prerequisite to interrogation,\u201d that an individual\nheld for questioning \u201cmust be clearly informed that he has\nthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer\nwith him during interrogation.\u201d Id., at 471. The question\nbefore us is whether the warnings Powell received satis\nfied this requirement.\n   The four warnings Miranda requires are invariable, but\nthis Court has not dictated the words in which the essen\ntial information must be conveyed. See California v.\nPrysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam) (\u201cThis\nCourt has never indicated that the rigidity of Miranda\nextends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a\ncriminal defendant.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nRhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 297 (1980) (safe\nguards against self-incrimination include \u201cMiranda warn\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

In determining whether\npolice officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we\nhave said, reviewing courts are not required to examine\nthe words employed \u201cas if construing a will or defining the\nterms of an easement. The inquiry is simply whether the\nwarnings reasonably \u2018conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as\nrequired by Miranda.\u2019 \u201d Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 203\n(quoting Prysock, 453 U. S., at 361).\n                              B\n    Our decisions in Prysock and Duckworth inform our\njudgment here. Both concerned a suspect\u2019s entitlement to\nadequate notification of the right to appointed counsel. In\nPrysock, an officer informed the suspect of, inter alia, his\nright to a lawyer\u2019s presence during questioning and his\nright to counsel appointed at no cost. 453 U. S., at 356\u2013\n357. The Court of Appeals held the advice inadequate to\ncomply with Miranda because it lacked an express state\nment that the appointment of an attorney would occur\nprior to the impending interrogation. See 453 U. S., at\n358\u2013359. We reversed. Id., at 362. \u201c[N]othing in the\nwarnings,\u201d we observed, \u201csuggested any limitation on the\nright to the presence of appointed counsel different from\nthe clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general, includ\ning the right to a lawyer before [the suspect is] questioned,\n. . . while [he is] being questioned, and all during the\nquestioning.\u201d Id., at 360\u2013361 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n    Similarly, in Duckworth, we upheld advice that, in\nrelevant part, communicated the right to have an attorney\npresent during the interrogation and the right to an ap\npointed attorney, but also informed the suspect that the\nlawyer would be appointed \u201cif and when [the suspect goes]\nto court.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201cThe Court of Appeals thought\nth[e] \u2018if and when you go to court\u2019 language suggested that\n\f10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nonly those accused who can afford an attorney have the\nright to have one present before answering any ques\ntions. \u201d Id., at 203 (some internal quotation marks omit\nted). We thought otherwise. Under the relevant state\nlaw, we noted, \u201ccounsel is appointed at [a] defendant\u2019s\ninitial appearance in court.\u201d Id., at 204. The \u201cif and when\nyou go to court\u201d advice, we said, \u201csimply anticipate[d]\u201d a\nquestion the suspect might be expected to ask after receiv\ning Miranda warnings, i.e., \u201cwhen [will he] obtain coun\nsel.\u201d 492 U. S., at 204. Reading the \u201cif and when\u201d lan\nguage together with the other information conveyed, we\nheld that the warnings, \u201cin their totality, satisfied\nMiranda.\u201d Id., at 205.\n   We reach the same conclusion in this case. The Tampa\nofficers did not \u201centirely omi[t],\u201d post, at 9, any informa\ntion Miranda required them to impart. They informed\nPowell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a lawyer before\nanswering any of [their] questions\u201d and \u201cthe right to use\nany of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e]\ninterview.\u201d App. 3. The first statement communicated\nthat Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering\nany particular question, and the second statement con\nfirmed that he could exercise that right while the interro\ngation was underway. In combination, the two warnings\nreasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an attorney\npresent, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all\ntimes.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the Court today approves, for \u201cthe\n\nfirst time[,] . . . a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely\nomitted an essential element of a suspect\u2019s rights.\u201d Post, at 9. See also\npost, at 12 (\u201c[T]he warning entirely failed to inform [Powell] of the\nseparate and distinct right \u2018to have counsel present during any ques\ntioning.\u2019 \u201d). We find the warning in this case adequate, however, only\nbecause it communicated just what Miranda prescribed. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS ascribes a different meaning to the warning Powell received,\nbut he cannot credibly suggest that the Court regards the warning to\nhave omitted a vital element of Powell\u2019s rights.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney\nwould not be present throughout the interrogation, the\nsuspect would have to imagine an unlikely scenario: To\nconsult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter\nthe interrogation room between each query. A reasonable\nsuspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his\nrights, we believe, would not come to the counterintuitive\nconclusion that he is obligated, or allowed, to hop in and\nout of the holding area to seek his attorney\u2019s advice.6\nInstead, the suspect would likely assume that he must\nstay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer\nwould be there with him the entire time.7\n   The Florida Supreme Court found the warning mislead\ning because it believed the temporal language\u2014that Pow\nell could \u201ctalk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d\u2014suggested Powell could consult with\nan attorney only before the interrogation started. 998\nSo. 2d, at 541. See also Brief for Respondent 28\u201329. In\ncontext, however, the term \u201cbefore\u201d merely conveyed when\nPowell\u2019s right to an attorney became effective\u2014namely,\nbefore he answered any questions at all. Nothing in the\nwords used indicated that counsel\u2019s presence would be\nrestricted after the questioning commenced. Instead, the\nwarning communicated that the right to counsel carried\nforward to and through the interrogation: Powell could\nseek his attorney\u2019s advice before responding to \u201cany of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions\u201d and \u201cat any time . . . during th[e]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 It is equally unlikely that the suspect would anticipate a scenario of\n\nthis order: His lawyer would be admitted into the interrogation room\neach time the police ask him a question, then ushered out each time the\nsuspect responds.\n  7 Although it does not bear on our decision, Powell seems to have\n\nunderstood the warning this way. The following exchange between\nPowell and his attorney occurred when Powell testified at his trial:\n  \u201cQ. You waived the right to have an attorney present during your\nquestioning by detectives; is that what you\u2019re telling this jury?\n  \u201cA. Yes.\u201d App. 80.\n\f12                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterview.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Although the warn\nings were not the clearest possible formulation of\nMiranda\u2019s right-to-counsel advisement, they were suffi\nciently comprehensive and comprehensible when given a\ncommonsense reading.\n   Pursuing a different line of argument, Powell points out\nthat most jurisdictions in Florida and across the Nation\nexpressly advise suspects of the right to have counsel\npresent both before and during interrogation. Brief for\nRespondent 41\u201344. If we find the advice he received ade\nquate, Powell suggests, law enforcement agencies, hoping\nto obtain uninformed waivers, will be tempted to end-run\nMiranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambi\nguity. Brief for Respondent 50\u201353. But as the United\nStates explained as amicus curiae in support of the State\nof Florida, \u201claw enforcement agencies have little reason to\nassume the litigation risk of experimenting with novel\nMiranda formulations,\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6; instead, it is \u201cdesirable police practice\u201d and \u201cin\nlaw enforcement\u2019s own interest\u201d to state warnings with\nmaximum clarity, id., at 12.

The stan\ndard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investiga\ntion are exemplary. They provide, in relevant part: \u201cYou\nhave the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask\nyou any questions. You have the right to have a lawyer\nwith you during questioning.\u201d Ibid., n. 3 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).

The Court\u2019s power to review that\ndecision is doubtful at best; moreover, the Florida Su\npreme Court has the better view on the merits.\n                             I\n  In this case, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that\n\u201c[b]oth Miranda and article I, section 9 of the Florida\nConstitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of\nthe right to have a lawyer present during questioning,\u201d\nand that the warnings given to Powell did not satisfy\neither the State or the Federal Constitution. 998 So. 2d\n531, 542 (2008). In my view, the Florida Supreme Court\nheld on an adequate and independent state-law ground\nthat the warnings provided to Powell did not sufficiently\ninform him of the \u201c \u2018right to a lawyer\u2019s help\u2019 \u201d under the\nFlorida Constitution, id., at 535. This Court therefore\nlacks jurisdiction to review the judgment below, notwith\nstanding the failure of that court to include some express\nsentence that would satisfy this Court\u2019s \u201cplain-statement\nrule,\u201d ante, at 5.\n  The adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine\nrests on two \u201ccornerstones\u201d: \u201c[r]espect for the independ\n\f2                       FLORIDA v.

S. 1032, 1040 (1983).\nIn Long, the Court adopted a novel presumption in favor\nof jurisdiction when the independence of a state court\u2019s\nstate-law judgment is not clear. But we only respect the\nindependence of state courts and avoid rendering advisory\nopinions if we limit the application of that presumption to\ntruly ambiguous cases.1 This is not such a case.\n  \u201c[I]f the same judgment would be rendered by the state\ncourt after we corrected its views of federal laws, our\nreview could amount to nothing more than an advisory\nopinion.\u201d Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 126 (1945). In\nLong we advised every state court of a formula by which it\ncould assure us that our review would indeed amount to\nnothing more than an advisory opinion. The state court\n\u201cneed only make clear by a plain statement in its judg\nment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only\nfor the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel\nthe result that the court has reached.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1041.\nThat advice has sometimes been misunderstood as a com\nmand that unless such a plain statement is included in a\nstate-court opinion, the court\u2019s ruling cannot have rested\non an adequate and independent state ground. But the\nreal question is whether \u201cthe adequacy and independence\nof any possible state law ground is . . . clear from the face\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In my view, this Court would better respect the independence of\n\nstate courts by applying the opposite presumption, as it did in the years\nprior to 1983. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1066\u20131067 (STEVENS, J., dissent\ning). But accepting Long as the law, we can limit its negative effects\u2014\nunnecessary intrusion into the business of the state courts and unnec\nessary advisory opinions\u2014only if we limit its application to cases in\nwhich the independence of the state-law ground is in serious doubt.\nSee Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 950 (1996) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he unfortunate effects of [its] rule\u201d are \u201cexacerbate[d]\n. . . to a nearly intolerable degree\u201d when the Long presumption is\napplied to cases in which \u201cthe state-law ground supporting th[e] judg\nmen[t] is so much clearer than has been true on most prior occasions\u201d).\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

Even if a state court\nopinion does not include the magic words set forth in\nLong, or some similarly explicit sentence, we lack jurisdic\ntion if it is nonetheless apparent that the decision is in\ndeed supported by an adequate and independent state\nground. Contrary to the assumption made by the Court,\nwe have no power to assume jurisdiction that does not\notherwise exist simply because the Florida Supreme Court\ndid not include in its decision some express statement that\nits interpretation of state law is independent.\n   In my view, we can tell from the face of the Florida\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe decision rested on a\nstate ground separate from Miranda,\u201d ante, at 6. This\ncase is easily distinguished from Long in that regard. In\nLong, although the Michigan Supreme Court had twice\ncited the Michigan Constitution in its opinion, it \u201crelied\nexclusively on its understanding of Terry [v. Ohio, 392\nU. S. 1 (1968),] and other federal cases. Not a single state\ncase was cited to support the state court\u2019s holding that the\nsearch of the passenger compartment was unconstitu\ntional.\u201d 463 U. S., at 1043. There was, in short, nothing\nto \u201cindicate that the decision below rested on grounds in\nany way independent from the state court\u2019s interpretation\nof federal law.\u201d Id., at 1044.\n   Other cases in which we have applied the Long pre\nsumption have been similarly devoid of independent state\nlaw analysis. We typically apply the Long presumption\nwhen the state court\u2019s decision cited a state constitutional\nprovision only a few times or not at all, and rested exclu\nsively upon federal cases or upon state cases that them\nselves cited only federal law.2 We have also applied Long\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See, e.g., Illinois v.

I, \u00a79 of the Florida\nConstitution. For example, after a paragraph describing\nthe general scope of Miranda warnings under federal law,\nthe Court explained the general scope of warnings under\nstate law. 998 So. 2d, at 534\u2013535 (\u201c[T]o ensure the volun\ntariness of confessions as required by article I, section 9 of\nthe Florida Constitution, this Court in Traylor v. State,\n596 So. 2d 957 (Fla. 1992), outlined the . . . rights Florida\nsuspects must be told of prior to custodial interrogation,\u201d\nwhich includes \u201c \u2018that they have a right to a lawyer\u2019s\nhelp\u2019 \u201d). The court consistently referred to these state-law\nrights as separate and distinct from Miranda, noting that\nin its earlier cases, it had explained that \u201cthe require\nments of both the Fifth Amendment, as explained in\nMiranda, and the Florida Constitution, as explained in\nTraylor,\u201d include \u201cthe requirement that a suspect be in\nformed of the right to have counsel present during ques\ntioning.\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 537\u2013538. And when applying the\nlaw to the specific facts of this case, the Florida Supreme\nCourt again invoked the specific and distinct \u201cright to a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourt\u2019s opinion analyzed federal law. 518 U. S., at 939. The Court\u2019s\nanalysis proved wrong; on remand, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\nreaffirmed its prior holding and \u201cexplicitly note[d] that it was, in fact,\ndecided upon independent grounds, i.e., Article I, Section 8 of the\nPennsylvania Constitution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Labron, 547 Pa. 344,\n345, 690 A. 2d 228 (1997). That we have overreached before is no\nreason to repeat the mistake again.\n   5 In examining what the state-court opinion said regarding state law,\n\nand whether the state precedent cited in the opinion relied upon state\nlaw, I am undertaking no effort more arduous than what the Court has\ntypically undertaken in order to determine whether the Long presump\ntion applies: examining how frequently a state-court opinion cited state\nlaw, whether state law is coextensive with federal law, and whether the\ncited state cases relied upon federal law. See nn. 2\u20133, supra.\n\f6                   FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlawyer\u2019s help\u201d under the Florida Constitution. Id., at 540.\n   Moreover, the state cases relied upon by the Florida\nSupreme Court did not themselves rely exclusively on\nfederal law. The primary case relied upon for the state\nlaw holding, Traylor, rested exclusively upon state law.\nSee 596 So. 2d, at 961. In that decision, the Florida Su\npreme Court embraced the principle that \u201c[w]hen called\nupon to decide matters of fundamental rights, Florida\u2019s\nstate courts are bound under federalist principles to give\nprimacy to our state Constitution and to give independent\nlegal import to every phrase and clause contained\ntherein.\u201d Id., at 962. Elaborating upon the meaning of\nArt. I, \u00a79 of the Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme\nCourt explained the roots of Florida\u2019s commitment to\nprotecting its citizens from self-incrimination. Florida has\nlong \u201crequired as a matter of state law that one charged\nwith a crime be informed of his rights prior to rendering a\nconfession.\u201d Id., at 964. It has required warnings before\nsome interrogations since at least 1889, and has for that\nlong excluded confessions obtained in violation of those\nrules. Ibid. In sum, this case looks quite different from\nthose cases in which we have applied the Long presump\ntion in the past.\n   The Court concludes otherwise by relying primarily\nupon the formulation of the certified question and re\nstatements of that question within the Florida Supreme\nCourt\u2019s opinion. See ante, at 6. Yet while the certified\nquestion asks whether particular phrases \u201cvitiate[d]\nMiranda warnings,\u201d 998 So. 2d, at 532 (capitalization and\nfootnote omitted), Miranda has become a generic term to\nrefer to the warnings suspects must be given before inter\nrogation, see Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 792\n(11th ed. 2003) (defining \u201cMiranda\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or\nbeing the legal rights of an arrested person to have an\nattorney and to remain silent so as to avoid self\nincrimination\u201d). Thus, its invocation of Miranda in the\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncertified question and in its statement of the issue\npresented is entirely consistent with the fact that the\nstate-law basis for its decision is fully adequate and\nindependent.\n   That said, I agree with the Court that the decision below\nis interwoven with federal law. In reaching its state-law\nholding, the Florida Supreme Court found Miranda and\nour other precedents instructive.6 But that alone is insuf\nficient to assure our jurisdiction, even under Long. In my\nview, the judgment\u2014reversal of Powell\u2019s conviction\u2014is\nsupported by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s independent\nand carefully considered holding that these warnings were\ninadequate under the Florida Constitution. See 998\nSo. 2d, at 534\u2013535, 537\u2013538, 540, 542.\n   The Court acknowledges that nothing in today\u2019s decision\n\u201ctrenches on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s authority to\nimpose, based on the State\u2019s Constitution, any additional\nprotections against coerced confessions it deems appropri\nate.\u201d Ante, at 7. As the Florida Supreme Court has noted\non more than one occasion, its interpretation of the Flor\nida Constitution\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination need\nnot track our construction of the parallel provision in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Florida Supreme Court need not have decided that state-law\n\nsources \u201cgave Powell rights . . . broader than . . . those delineated in\nMiranda,\u201d ante, at 6, in order for its judgment to have rested upon an\nindependent state-law ground. The independence of a state-law ground\nmay be especially clear when a state court explicitly finds that the state\nconstitution is more protective of a certain right than the national\ncharter, but a state constitutional provision is no less independent for\nproviding the same protection in a given case as does the federal\nprovision, so long as the content of the state-law right is not compelled\nby or dependent upon federal law. Unlike other provisions of Art. I of\nthe Florida Constitution, \u00a79 does not contain an express proviso requir\ning that the right be construed in conformity with the analogous federal\nprovision. Compare Fla. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, with Fla. Const., Art I, \u00a712.\nFurthermore, under Florida law the scope of Art. I, \u00a79 is clearly not\ndependent upon federal law. Rigterink v. State, 2 So. 3d 221, 241 (Fla.\n2009); Traylor v. State, 596 So. 2d 957, 962 (Fla. 1992).\n\f8                   FLORIDA v.

In this\nvery case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its\njudgment upon remand. If the Florida Supreme Court\ndoes so, as I expect it will, this Court\u2019s opinion on the\nmerits will qualify as the sort of advisory opinion that we\nshould studiously seek to avoid.\n                             II\n  The Court\u2019s decision on the merits is also unpersuasive.\nAs we recognized in Miranda, \u201cthe right to have counsel\npresent at [an] interrogation is indispensable to the pro\ntection of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436, 469 (1966). Furthermore, \u201cthe\nneed for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege\ncomprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel\nprior to questioning, but also to have counsel present\nduring any questioning.\u201d Id., at 470. Because the \u201cac\ncused who does not know his rights and therefore does not\nmake a request may be the person who most needs coun\nsel,\u201d id., at 470\u2013471, a defendant \u201cmust be clearly in\nformed\u201d regarding two aspects of his right to consult an\nattorney: \u201cthe right to consult with a lawyer and to have\nthe lawyer with him during interrogation,\u201d id., at 471.\n  In this case, the form regularly used by the Tampa\npolice warned Powell that he had \u201cthe right to talk to a\nlawyer before answering any of our questions.\u201d App. 3.\nThis informed him only of the right to consult with a\nlawyer before questioning, the very right the Miranda\nCourt identified as insufficient to protect the Fifth\nAmendment privilege. The warning did not say anything\nabout the right to have counsel present during interroga\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion. Although we have never required \u201crigidity in the\nform of the required warnings,\u201d California v. Prysock, 453\nU. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam), this is, I believe, the\nfirst time the Court has approved a warning which, if\ngiven its natural reading, entirely omitted an essential\nelement of a suspect\u2019s rights.\n   Despite the failure of the warning to mention it, in the\nCourt\u2019s view the warning \u201creasonably conveyed\u201d to Powell\nthat he had the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence during the\ninterrogation. Ante, at 10. The Court cobbles together\nthis conclusion from two elements of the warning. First,\nthe Court assumes the warning regarding Powell\u2019s right\n\u201cto talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers\u2019]\nquestions,\u201d App. 3, conveyed that \u201cPowell could consult\nwith a lawyer before answering any particular question,\u201d\nante, at 10 (emphasis added).7 Second, in the Court\u2019s\nview, the addition of a catchall clause at the end of the\nrecitation of rights \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Powell could use his\nright to consult an attorney \u201cwhile the interrogation was\nunderway.\u201d Ibid.\n   The more natural reading of the warning Powell was\ngiven, which (1) contained a temporal limit and (2) failed\nto mention his right to the presence of counsel in the\ninterrogation room, is that Powell only had the right to\nconsult with an attorney before the interrogation began,\nnot that he had the right to have an attorney with him\nduring questioning. Even those few Courts of Appeals\nthat have approved warnings that did not expressly men\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Thisassumption makes it easier for the Court to conclude the warn\ning conveyed a right to have a lawyer present. If a suspect is told he\nhas the right to consult with an attorney before answering any particu\nlar question, the Court may be correct that he would reasonably con\nclude he has the right to a lawyer\u2019s presence because otherwise he\nwould have to imagine he could consult his attorney in some unlikely\nfashion (e.g., by leaving the interrogation room between every ques\ntion).\n\f10                       FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion the right to an attorney\u2019s presence during interroga\ntion8 have found language of the sort used in Powell\u2019s\nwarning to be misleading. For instance, petitioner cites\nthe Second Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Lamia,\n429 F. 2d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying\nthe properly flexible approach to Miranda. But in that\ncase, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning\nthat a suspect \u201c \u2018could consult an attorney prior to any\nquestion,\u2019 \u201d which was \u201caffirmatively misleading since it\nwas thought to imply that the attorney could not be pre\nsent during questioning.\u201d 429 F. 2d, at 377.9 That even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not\n\nexpressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during\ninterrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his Miranda\nrights. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman, 963 F. 2d 137, 141 (CA6\n1992); United States v. Bland, 908 F. 2d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); United\nStates v. Anthon, 648 F. 2d 669, 672\u2013673 (CA10 1981); Windsor v.\nUnited States, 389 F. 2d 530, 533 (CA5 1968). And most of the Circuits\nthat have not required express mention of the right to an attorney\u2019s\npresence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to\nan attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the\nright to counsel\u2019s presence during interrogation but which also con\ntained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad\nnature of his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Frankson, 83\nF. 3d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); United States v. Caldwell, 954 F. 2d 496, 502\n(CA8 1992); United States v. Adams, 484 F. 2d 357, 361\u2013362 (CA7\n1973). I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his \u201cright to counsel,\u201d\nwithout more, reasonably conveys a suspect\u2019s full rights under\nMiranda, but at least such a general warning does not include the same\nsort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell\u2019s warning.\n  9 Petitioner also cites Bridgers v. Dretke, 431 F. 3d 853 (CA5 2005), in\n\nwhich the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did\nnot unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding\nadequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that \u201che had the\nright to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.\u201d\nId., at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that\nwarning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an\nattorney\u2019s presence during interrogation, the fact that the warning\nmentioned an attorney\u2019s presence materially distinguishes it from the\nwarning Powell received. The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Courts of Appeals taking the most flexible approach to\nMiranda have found warnings like Powell\u2019s misleading\nshould caution the Court against concluding that such a\nwarning reasonably conveyed Powell\u2019s right to have an\nattorney with him during the interrogation.\n   When the relevant clause of the warning in this case is\ngiven its most natural reading, the catchall clause does\nnot meaningfully clarify Powell\u2019s rights. It communicated\nthat Powell could exercise the previously listed rights at\nany time. Yet the only previously listed right was the\n\u201cright to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the\nofficers\u2019] questions.\u201d App. 3 (emphasis added). Informing\nPowell that he could exercise, at any time during the\ninterview, the right to talk to a lawyer before answering\nany questions did not reasonably convey the right to talk\nto a lawyer after answering some questions, much less\nimplicitly inform Powell of his right to have a lawyer with\nhim at all times during interrogation. An intelligent\nsuspect could reasonably conclude that all he was provided\nwas a one-time right to consult with an attorney, not a\nright to have an attorney present with him in the interro\ngation room at all times.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate court\u2019s assessment that warning a suspect solely that \u201che had the\nright to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning . . . might\nhave created the [impermissible] impression that the attorney could not\nbe present during interrogation.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   10 The Court supports its analysis by taking note of Powell\u2019s testi\n\nmony at trial, given after the trial judge had overruled his lawyer\u2019s\nobjection that the warning he received was inadequate. In my view, the\ntestimony in context is not probative of what Powell thought the\nwarnings meant. It did not explore what Powell understood the warn\nings to mean, but simply established, as a prelude to Powell\u2019s testimony\nexplaining his prior statement, that he had waived his rights. Regard\nless, the testimony is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges. \u201cNo\namount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware\nof [the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation] will suffice\nto stand\u201d in the stead of an adequate warning. Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n\f12                      FLORIDA v. POWELL\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court relies on Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195\n(1989), and Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, but in neither case did\nthe warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect\u2019s\nrights. In Prysock, the warning regarding the right to an\nappointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see\nid., at 360\u2013361, which clearly distinguishes that case from\nPowell\u2019s. In Duckworth, the suspect was explicitly in\nformed that he had the right \u201cto talk to a lawyer for advice\nbefore we ask you any questions, and to have him with you\nduring questioning,\u201d and that he had \u201cthis right to the\nadvice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford\nto hire one.\u201d 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted). The warning thus conveyed in\nfull the right to appointed counsel before and during the\ninterrogation. Although the warning was arguably under\ncut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would\nbe appointed \u201cif and when you go to court,\u201d the Court\nfound the suspect was informed of his full rights and the\nwarning simply added additional, truthful information\nregarding when counsel would be appointed. Ibid. (em\nphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike\nthe Duckworth warning, Powell\u2019s warning did not convey\nhis Miranda rights in full with the addition of some ar\nguably misleading statement. Rather, the warning en\ntirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct\nright \u201cto have counsel present during any questioning.\u201d\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 470.\n   In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not rea\nsonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with\nhim during the interrogation. \u201cThe requirement of warn\nings . . . [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth\nAmendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual\nto existing methods of interrogation.\u201d Id., at 476.

See ante, at 12.\nAs the majority\u2019s decision today demonstrates, reasonable\njudges may well differ over the question whether the\ndeficiency is serious enough to violate the Federal Consti\ntution.

Peti\n  tioner Hemi Group, based in New Mexico, sells cigarettes online to\n  residents of the City. Neither state nor city law requires out-of-state\n  sellers such as Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the City\u2019s tax; in\n  stead, the City must recover its tax on out-of-state sales directly from\n  the purchasers. But the Jenkins Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378, requires\n  out-of-state sellers to submit customer information to the States into\n  which they ship cigarettes, and New York State has agreed to for\n  ward that information to the City. That information helps the City\n  track down cigarette purchasers who do not pay their taxes. Against\n  that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under the Racketeer Influ\n  enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), alleging that Hemi\u2019s\n  failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the State constituted mail\n  and wire fraud, which are defined as \u201cracketeering activit[ies],\u201d 18\n  U.

Proximate cause for RICO purposes should be evaluated in light\n    of its common-law foundations; it thus requires \u201csome direct relation\n    between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\n    A link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindirec[t]\u201d is in\n    sufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n       The City\u2019s causal theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship\n    requirement. Indeed, the causal link here is far more attenuated\n    than the one the Court rejected as \u201cpurely contingent\u201d and \u201ctoo re\n    mote\u201d in Holmes. Id., at 271. According to the City, Hemi committed\n    fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and failing to submit the\n    required customer information to the State. Without the reports\n    from Hemi, the State could not pass on the information to the City,\n    even if it had been so inclined. Some of the customers legally obli\n    gated to pay the cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\n    City did not receive the customer information, it could not determine\n    which customers had failed to pay the tax. The City thus could not\n    pursue those customers for payment. The City thereby was injured\n    in the amount of the portion of back taxes that were never collected.\n    As the Court reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency of the law,\n    in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step,\u201d id.,\n    at 271\u2013272, and that \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\n    proximate cause inquiries under RICO, e.g., ibid. Because the City\u2019s\n    causation theory requires the Court to move well beyond the first\n    step, that theory cannot satisfy RICO\u2019s direct relationship require\n    ment.\n       The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the RICO claim re\n    jected in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 458\u2013461,\n    where the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct from the\n    conduct giving rise to the fraud, see id., at 458. Indeed, the discon\n    nect between the asserted injury and the alleged fraud in this case is\n    even sharper. In Anza, the same party had both engaged in the\n    harmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. Here, the City\u2019s\n    theory of liability rests not just on separate actions, but separate ac\n    tions carried out by separate parties. The City\u2019s theory thus requires\n    that the Court extend RICO liability to situations where the defen\n    dant\u2019s fraud on the third party (the State) has made it easier for a\n    fourth party (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the City).\n    Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused harm to the City\n    in the first place if they decided not to pay taxes they were legally ob\n    ligated to pay. Put simply, Hemi\u2019s obligation was to file Jenkins Act\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                        3\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  reports with the State, not the City, and the City\u2019s harm was directly\n  caused by the customers, not Hemi. The Court has never before\n  stretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and declines to\n  do so today. See, e.g., id., at 460\u2013461. Pp. 5\u20139.\n    (b) The City attempts to avoid this conclusion by characterizing the\n  violation not merely as Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports with\n  the State, but as a more general systematic scheme to defraud the\n  City of tax revenue. But if the City could escape the proximate-cause\n  requirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme embraced\n  all those indirectly harmed by the alleged conduct, the Court\u2019s RICO\n  proximate cause precedent would become a mere pleading rule. That\n  precedent makes clear that \u201cthe compensable injury flowing from a\n  [RICO] violation . . . \u2018necessarily is the harm caused by [the] predi\n  cate acts.\u2019 \u201d Anza, supra, at 457. Because the only fraudulent con\n  duct alleged here is a violation of the Jenkins Act, the City must, but\n  cannot, show that Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports led\n  directly to its injuries.\n    The City also errs in relying on Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem\n  nity Co., 553 U. S. ___. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 causation theory was\n  \u201cstraightforward\u201d: The causal link in Bridge involved a direct and\n  easily identifiable connection between the fraud at issue and the\n  plaintiffs\u2019 injury, id., at ___; the plaintiffs there \u201cwere the only parties\n  injured by petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations,\u201d id., at ___; and there\n  were \u201cno independent factors that account[ed] for [the] injury,\u201d id., at\n  ___. The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straightfor\n  ward: Multiple steps separate the alleged fraud from the asserted in\n  jury. And in contrast to Bridge, where there were \u201cno independent\n  factors that account[ed] for [the plaintiffs\u2019] injury,\u201d id., at ___, here\n  there certainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the inde\n  pendent actions of third and even fourth parties.

Neither state nor city law re\u00ad\nquires Hemi to charge, collect, or remit the tax, and the\npurchasers seldom pay it on their own. Federal law,\nhowever, requires out-of-state vendors such as Hemi to\nsubmit customer information to the States into which they\nship the cigarettes.\n   Against that backdrop, the City filed this lawsuit under\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(RICO), alleging that Hemi failed to file the required\ncustomer information with the State. That failure, the\nCity argues, constitutes mail and wire fraud, which caused\nit to lose tens of millions of dollars in unrecovered ciga\u00ad\nrette taxes. Because the City cannot show that it lost the\ntax revenue \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged RICO violation, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71964(c), we hold that the City cannot state a\nclaim under RICO. We therefore reverse the Court of\n\f2          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals\u2019 decision to the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  This case arises from a motion to dismiss, and so we\naccept as true the factual allegations in the City\u2019s second\namended complaint. See Leatherman v. Tarrant County\nNarcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S.\n163, 164 (1993).\n  New York State authorizes the City of New York to\nimpose its own taxes on cigarettes. N. Y. Unconsol. Law\nAnn. \u00a79436(1) (West Supp. 2009). Under that authority,\nthe City has levied a $1.50 per pack tax on each standard\npack of cigarettes possessed within the City for sale or use.\nN. Y. C. Admin. Code \u00a711\u20131302(a) (2008); see also Record\nA1016. When purchasers buy cigarettes from in-state\nvendors, the seller is responsible for charging, collecting,\nand remitting the tax. N. Y. Tax Law Ann. \u00a7471(2) (West\nSupp. 2009). Out-of-state vendors, however, are not.\nIbid.; see City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc.,\n541 F. 3d 425, 432\u2013433 (CA2 2008). Instead, the City is\nresponsible for recovering, directly from the customers,\nuse taxes on cigarettes sold outside New York. That can\nbe difficult, as those customers are often reluctant to pay\nand tough to track down. One way the City can gather\ninformation that would assist it in collecting the back\ntaxes is through the Jenkins Act, 63 Stat. 884, as amended\nby 69 Stat. 627. That Act requires out-of-state cigarette\nsellers to register and to file a report with state tobacco\ntax administrators listing the name, address, and quantity\nof cigarettes purchased by state residents. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7375\u2013378.\n  New York State and the City have executed an agree\u00ad\nment under which both parties undertake to \u201ccooperate\nfully with each other and keep each other fully and\npromptly informed with reference to any person or trans\u00ad\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The\nCity asserts that under that agreement, the State for\u00ad\nwards Jenkins Act information to the City. Id., at A998;\nSecond Amended Compl. \u00b654.

Hemi, however, does not file Jenkins Act\ninformation with the State. The City alleges that this\nfailure has cost it \u201ctens if not hundreds of millions of\ndollars a year in cigarette excise tax revenue.\u201d Record\nA996. Based on Hemi\u2019s failure to file the information with\nthe State, the City filed this federal RICO claim.\n                              B\n  RICO provides a private cause of action for \u201c[a]ny per\u00ad\nson injured in his business or property by reason of a\nviolation of section 1962 of this chapter.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71964(c). Section 1962, in turn, contains RICO\u2019s criminal\nprovisions. Specifically, \u00a71962(c), which the City invokes\nhere, makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities\nof which affect, interstate . . . commerce, to conduct or\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d \u201c[R]acketeering activity\u201d is defined to include a\nnumber of so-called predicate acts, including the two at\nissue in this case\u2014mail and wire fraud. See \u00a71961(1).\n  The City alleges that Hemi\u2019s \u201cinterstate sale of ciga\u00ad\nrettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports identify\u00ad\ning those sales\u201d constitute the RICO predicate offenses of\nmail and wire fraud in violation of \u00a71962(c), for which\n\f4          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71964(c) provides a private cause of action. Record A980.\nInvoking that private cause of action, the City asserts that\nit has suffered injury in the form of lost tax revenue\u2014its\n\u201cbusiness or property\u201d in RICO terms\u2014\u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s fraud.\n   Hemi does not contest the City\u2019s characterization of the\nJenkins Act violations as predicate offenses actionable\nunder \u00a71964(c). (We therefore assume, without deciding,\nthat failure to file Jenkins Act material can serve as a\nRICO predicate offense.) Instead, Hemi argues that the\nCity\u2019s asserted injury\u2014lost tax revenue\u2014is not \u201cbusiness\nor property\u201d under RICO, and that the City cannot show\nthat it suffered any injury \u201cby reason of\u201d the failure to file\nJenkins Act reports.\n   The District Court dismissed the City\u2019s RICO claims,\ndetermining that Hemi owner and officer Kai Gachupin\ndid not have an individual duty to file Jenkins Act reports,\nand thus could not have committed the alleged predicate\nacts. City of New York v. Nexicon, Inc., No. 03 CV 383\n(DAB), 2006 WL 647716, *7\u2013*8 (SDNY, Mar. 15, 2006).\nThe District Court therefore held that the City could not\nestablish that Hemi and Gachupin formed an \u201centerprise\u201d\nas required to establish RICO liability. Id., at *7\u2013*10.\nBecause it dismissed on that ground, the District Court\ndid not address whether the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue\nconstitutes an injury to its \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under\n\u00a71964, or whether that injury was caused \u201cby reason of\u201d\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports.\n   The Second Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s judg\u00ad\nment and remanded for further proceedings. The Court of\nAppeals held that the City had established that Gachupin\nand Hemi operated as an \u201centerprise\u201d and that the enter\u00ad\nprise committed the predicate RICO acts of mail and wire\nfraud, based on the failure to file the Jenkins Act material\nwith the State. 541 F. 3d, at 447\u2013448. The court also\ndetermined that the City\u2019s asserted injury, lost tax reve\u00ad\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

And that injury, the court concluded, came about \u201cby\nreason of\u201d the predicate mail and wire frauds. Id., at 440\u2013\n444. The City thus had stated a viable RICO claim.\nJudge Winter dissented on the ground that the alleged\nRICO violation was not the proximate cause of the City\u2019s\ninjury. Id., at 458\u2013461.\n   Hemi filed a petition for certiorari, asking this Court to\ndetermine whether the City had been \u201cdirectly injured in\nits \u2018business or property\u2019 \u201d by reason of the alleged mail\nand wire frauds. Pet. for Cert. i. We granted that peti\u00ad\ntion. 556 U. S. __ (2009).\n                             II\n  Though framed as a single question, Hemi\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari raises two distinct issues: First, whether a loss\nin tax revenue is \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71964(c); and second, whether the City\u2019s asserted injury\ncame about \u201cby reason of\u201d the allegedly fraudulent con\u00ad\nduct, as required by \u00a71964(c). We determine that the City\ncannot satisfy the causation requirement\u2014that any injury\nthe City suffered must be \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged\nfrauds\u2014and therefore do not decide whether the City\u2019s\nallegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its\n\u201cbusiness or property.\u201d\n                             A\n   In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,\n503 U. S. 258 (1992), we set forth the standard of causa\u00ad\ntion that applies to civil RICO claims. In that case, we\naddressed a RICO claim brought by Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) against defendants whom\nSIPC alleged had manipulated stock prices. Id., at 262\u2013\n263. SIPC had a duty to reimburse customers of certain\nregistered broker-dealers in the event the broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their financial obligations. Id., at\n\f6         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n261. When the conspiracy by the stock manipulators was\ndetected, stock prices collapsed, and two broker-dealers\nwere unable to meet their obligations to their customers.\nSIPC, as insurer against that loss, ultimately was on the\nhook for nearly $13 million to cover the customers\u2019 claims.\nThe Court held that SIPC could not recover against the\nconspirators because it could not establish that it was\ninjured \u201cby reason of\u201d the alleged fraud, as that phrase is\nused in RICO.\n   We explained that, to state a claim under civil RICO,\nthe plaintiff is required to show that a RICO predicate\noffense \u201cnot only was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but\nwas the proximate cause as well.\u201d Id., at 268. Proximate\ncause for RICO purposes, we made clear, should be evalu\u00ad\nated in light of its common-law foundations; proximate\ncause thus requires \u201csome direct relation between the\ninjury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d Ibid.\nA link that is \u201ctoo remote,\u201d \u201cpurely contingent,\u201d or \u201cindi\u00ad\nrec[t]\u201d is insufficient. Id., at 271, 274.\n   Applying that standard, we rejected SIPC\u2019s RICO claim.\nThe alleged conspiracy, we held, directly harmed only the\nbroker-dealers; SIPC\u2019s injury, on the other hand, was\n\u201cpurely contingent\u201d on that harm. Id., at 271. The con\u00ad\nnection between the alleged conspiracy and SIPC\u2019s injury\nwas therefore \u201ctoo remote\u201d to satisfy RICO\u2019s direct rela\u00ad\ntionship requirement. Ibid.\n   The City\u2019s causal theory is far more attenuated than the\none we rejected in Holmes. According to the City, Hemi\ncommitted fraud by selling cigarettes to city residents and\nfailing to submit the required customer information to the\nState. Without the reports from Hemi, the State could not\npass on the information to the City, even if it had been so\ninclined. Some of the customers legally obligated to pay\nthe cigarette tax to the City failed to do so. Because the\nCity did not receive the customer information, the City\ncould not determine which customers had failed to pay the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntax. The City thus could not pursue those customers for\npayment. The City thereby was injured in the amount of\nthe portion of back taxes that were never collected. See\nRecord A996.\n   But as we reiterated in Holmes, \u201c[t]he general tendency\nof the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go be\u00ad\nyond the first step.\u201d 503 U. S., at 271\u2013272 (quoting Asso\nciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 534 (1983), in turn quoting Southern Pacific Co.\nv. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U. S. 531, 533 (1918),\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Our cases confirm\nthat the \u201cgeneral tendency\u201d applies with full force to\nproximate cause inquiries under RICO. Holmes, supra, at\n271\u2013272; see also Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity\nCo., 553 U. S. __, __ (2008) (slip op., at 18\u201319); Anza v.\nIdeal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 460\u2013461 (2006).\nBecause the City\u2019s theory of causation requires us to move\nwell beyond the first step, that theory cannot meet RICO\u2019s\ndirect relationship requirement.\n   Our decision in Anza, supra, confirms that the City\u2019s\ntheory of causation is far too indirect. There we consid\u00ad\nered a RICO claim brought by Ideal Steel Supply against\nits competitor, National Steel Supply. Ideal alleged that\nNational had defrauded New York State by failing to\ncharge and remit sales taxes, and that National was thus\nable to undercut Ideal\u2019s prices. The lower prices offered by\nNational, Ideal contended, allowed National to attract\ncustomers at Ideal\u2019s expense. Id., at 458.\n   Finding the link between the fraud alleged and injury\nsuffered to be \u201cattenuated,\u201d we rejected Ideal\u2019s claim. Id.,\nat 459. \u201cThe direct victim of this conduct,\u201d we held, was\n\u201cthe State of New York, not Ideal.\u201d Id., at 458. \u201cIt was the\nState that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax\nrevenue as a result.\u201d Ibid. We recognized that Ideal had\nasserted \u201cits own harms when [National] failed to charge\ncustomers for the applicable sales tax.\u201d Ibid. But the\n\f8          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncause of Ideal\u2019s harm was \u201ca set of actions (offering lower\nprices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation\n(defrauding the State).\u201d Ibid. The alleged violation there\u00ad\nfore had not \u201cled directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries,\u201d and\nIdeal accordingly had failed to meet RICO\u2019s \u201crequirement\nof a direct causal connection\u201d between the predicate of\u00ad\nfense and the alleged harm. Id., at 460\u2013461.\n   The City\u2019s claim suffers from the same defect as the\nclaim in Anza. Here, the conduct directly responsible for\nthe City\u2019s harm was the customers\u2019 failure to pay their\ntaxes. And the conduct constituting the alleged fraud was\nHemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports. Thus, as in\nAnza, the conduct directly causing the harm was distinct\nfrom the conduct giving rise to the fraud. See id., at 458.\n   Indeed, the disconnect between the asserted injury and\nthe alleged fraud in this case is even sharper than in\nAnza. There, we viewed the point as important because\nthe same party\u2014National Steel\u2014had both engaged in the\nharmful conduct and committed the fraudulent act. We\nnevertheless found the distinction between the relevant\nacts sufficient to defeat Ideal\u2019s RICO claim. Here, the\nCity\u2019s theory of liability rests not just on separate actions,\nbut separate actions carried out by separate parties.\n   The City\u2019s theory thus requires that we extend RICO\nliability to situations where the defendant\u2019s fraud on the\nthird party (the State) has made it easier for a fourth\nparty (the taxpayer) to cause harm to the plaintiff (the\nCity). Indeed, the fourth-party taxpayers here only caused\nharm to the City in the first place if they decided not to\npay taxes they were legally obligated to pay. Put simply,\nHemi\u2019s obligation was to file the Jenkins Act reports with\nthe State, not the City, and the City\u2019s harm was directly\ncaused by the customers, not Hemi. We have never before\nstretched the causal chain of a RICO violation so far, and\nwe decline to do so today. See id., at 460\u2013461; cf. Associ\nated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 541, n. 46 (finding no\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The State certainly is\nbetter situated than the City to seek recovery from Hemi.\nAnd the State has an incentive to sue\u2014the State imposes\nits own $2.75 per pack tax on cigarettes possessed within\nthe State, nearly double what the City charges. N. Y. Tax\nLaw Ann. \u00a7471(1) (West Supp. 2009). We do not opine on\nwhether the State could bring a RICO action for any lost\ntax revenue. Suffice it to say that the State would have\nconcrete incentives to try. See Anza, supra, at 460 (\u201cIdeal\naccuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out\nof a substantial amount of money. If the allegations are\ntrue, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate\nremedies\u201d).\n   The dissent would have RICO\u2019s proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement turn on foreseeability, rather than on the exis\u00ad\ntence of a sufficiently \u201cdirect relationship\u201d between the\nfraud and the harm. It would find that the City has satis\u00ad\nfied that requirement because \u201cthe harm is foreseeable; it\nis a consequence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and\nit falls well within the set of risks that Congress sought to\nprevent.\u201d Post, at 6 (opinion of BREYER, J.). If this line of\nreasoning sounds familiar, it should. It is precisely the\nargument lodged against the majority opinion in Anza.\nThere, the dissent criticized the majority\u2019s view for \u201cper\u00ad\nmit[ting] a defendant to evade liability for harms that are\nnot only foreseeable, but the intended consequences of\nthe defendant\u2019s unlawful behavior.\u201d 547 U. S., at 470\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut the dissent there did not carry the day, and no one\nhas asked us to revisit Anza.\n\f10           HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The concepts of direct relationship and foreseeability are\nof course two of the \u201cmany shapes [proximate cause] took\nat common law,\u201d Holmes, supra, at 268. Our precedents\nmake clear that in the RICO context, the focus is on the\ndirectness of the relationship between the conduct and the\nharm. Indeed, Anza and Holmes never even mention the\nconcept of foreseeability.\n                             B\n   The City offers a number of responses. It first chal\u00ad\nlenges our characterization of the violation at issue. In\nthe City\u2019s view, the violation is not merely Hemi\u2019s failure\nto file Jenkins Act information with the State, but a more\ngeneral \u201csystematic scheme to defraud the City of tax\nrevenue.\u201d Brief for Respondent 42. Having broadly de\u00ad\nfined the violation, the City contends that it has been\ndirectly harmed by reason of that systematic scheme.\nIbid.\n   But the City cannot escape the proximate cause re\u00ad\nquirement merely by alleging that the fraudulent scheme\nembraced all those indirectly harmed by the alleged con\u00ad\nduct. Otherwise our RICO proximate cause precedent\nwould become a mere pleading rule. In Anza, for example,\nIdeal alleged that National\u2019s scheme \u201cwas to give National\na competitive advantage over Ideal.\u201d 547 U. S., at 454\u2013\n455. But that allegation did not prevent the Court from\nconcluding that National\u2019s fraud directly harmed only the\nState, not Ideal. As the Court explained, Ideal could not\n\u201ccircumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by\nclaiming that the defendant\u2019s aim was to increase market\nshare at a competitor\u2019s expense.\u201d Id., at 460.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Even if we were willing to look to Hemi\u2019s intent, as the dissent sug\u00ad\n\ngests we should, the City would fare no better. Hemi\u2019s aim was not to\ndefraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to\nsell more cigarettes. Hemi itself neither owed taxes nor was obliged to\ncollect and remit them. This all suggests that Hemi\u2019s alleged fraud was\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our precedent makes clear, moreover, that \u201cthe com\u00ad\npensable injury flowing from a [RICO] violation . . . \u2018neces\u00ad\nsarily is the harm caused by [the] predicate acts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n457 (quoting Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S.\n479, 497 (1985)). In its RICO statement, the City alleged\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file Jenkins Act reports constituted\nthe predicate act of mail and wire fraud. Record A980.\nThe City went on to allege that this predicate act \u201cdirectly\ncaused\u201d its harm, id., at A996, but that assertion is a legal\nconclusion about proximate cause\u2014indeed, the very legal\nconclusion before us. The only fraudulent conduct alleged\nhere is a violation of the Jenkins Act. See 541 F. 3d, at\n459 (Winter, J., dissenting). Thus, the City must show\nthat Hemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports with the\nState led directly to its injuries. This it cannot do.\n   The City also relies on Bridge, 553 U. S. ___. Bridge\nreaffirmed the requirement that there must be \u201ca suffi\u00ad\nciently direct relationship between the defendant\u2019s wrong\u00ad\nful conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18). The case involved competing bidders at a county\ntax-lien auction. Because the liens were profitable even at\nthe lowest possible bid, multiple bidders offered that low\nbid. (The bidding took the form of the percentage tax\npenalty the bidder would require the property owner to\npay, so the lowest possible bid was 0%.) To decide which\nbidder would be awarded the lien, the county devised a\nplan to allocate the liens \u201con a rotational basis.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nas we noted in that case, this created a \u201cperverse incen\u00ad\ntive\u201d: \u201cBidders who, in addition to bidding themselves,\nsen[t] agents to bid on their behalf [would] obtain a dis\u00ad\nproportionate share of liens.\u201d Ibid. The county therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\naimed at Hemi\u2019s competitors, not the City. But Anza teaches that the\n\ncompetitors\u2019 injuries in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO\n\nclaim.\n\n\f12         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprohibited bidders from using such agents. Ibid.\n   A losing bidder alleged that a competitor had defrauded\nthe county by employing shadow bidders to secure a\ngreater proportion of liens than it was due. We held that\nthe bidder-plaintiff had met RICO\u2019s causation require\u00ad\nment. Distinguishing that claim from the one at issue in\nAnza, we noted that the plaintiff\u2019s theory of causation in\nBridge was \u201cstraightforward\u201d: Because of the zero-sum\nnature of the auction, and because the county awarded\nbids on a rotational basis, each time a fraud-induced bid\nwas awarded, a particular legitimate bidder was necessar\u00ad\nily passed over. 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The\nlosing bidders, moreover, \u201cwere the only parties injured by\npetitioners\u2019 misrepresentations.\u201d Ibid. The county was\nnot; it received the same revenue regardless of which\nbidder prevailed.\n   The City\u2019s theory in this case is anything but straight\u00ad\nforward: Multiple steps, as we have detailed, separate the\nalleged fraud from the asserted injury. And in contrast to\nBridge, where there were \u201cno independent factors that\naccount[ed] for [the plaintiff\u2019s] injury,\u201d ibid., here there\ncertainly were: The City\u2019s theory of liability rests on the\nindependent actions of third and even fourth parties.\n   The City at various points during the proceedings below\ndescribed its injury as the lost \u201copportunity to tax\u201d rather\nthan \u201clost tax revenue.\u201d It is not clear that there is a\nsubstantive distinction between the two descriptions. In\nany event, before this Court, the City\u2019s argument turned\non lost revenue, not a lost opportunity to collect it. See,\ne.g., Brief for Respondent i (\u201cCounter-Question Pre\u00ad\nsented[:] Does the City of New York have standing under\nRICO because lost tax revenue constitutes a direct injury\nto the City\u2019s \u2018business or property\u2019 in accord with the\nstatute, 18 U.

Brief for\nPetitioners 25 (\u201cThe opportunity to collect taxes from\nthose who did owe them . . . falls within a class of expecta\u00ad\ntion interests that do not qualify as injury to business or\nproperty and therefore do not confer civil RICO standing\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see Cleveland v.\nUnited States, 531 U. S. 12, 15 (2000) (\u201cIt does not suffice\n. . . that the object of the fraud may become property in the\nrecipient\u2019s hands; for purposes of the mail fraud statute,\nthe thing obtained must be property in the hands of the\nvictim\u201d).\n    That is not to say, however, that the City would fare any\nbetter on the causation question had it framed its argu\u00ad\nment in terms of a lost opportunity. Hemi\u2019s filing obliga\u00ad\ntion would still be to the State, and any harm to the City\nwould still be caused directly by the customers\u2019 failure to\npay their taxes. See 541 F. 3d, at 461 (Winter, J., dissent\u00ad\ning). Whatever the City\u2019s reasons for framing its merits\narguments as it has, we will not reformulate them for it\nnow.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The dissent recognizes that its position poses the troubling specter\nof turning RICO into a tax collection statute. Post, at 11\u201312 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). The dissent\u2019s answer looks largely to prosecution policy set\nforth in the Federal Department of Justice Guidelines, which are, of\ncourse, not only changeable, but have no applicability whatever to state\nor local governments. Under the decision below and the dissent\u2019s\nposition, RICO could be used as a tax collection device based solely on\nthe failure to file reports under the Jenkins Act, which itself provides\nquite limited remedies. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7377 (providing that a violation\nof the Jenkins Act may be punished as a misdemeanor with a fine up to\n$1,000 and imprisonment for no more than six months). And that\n\f14          HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  In a final effort to save its claim, the City has shifted\ncourse before this Court. In its second amended complaint\nand RICO statement, the City relied solely on Hemi\u2019s\nfailure to file Jenkins Act reports with the State to form\nthe basis of the predicate act mail and wire frauds. See\nSecond Amended Compl. \u00b6\u00b699, 101, 118, 125; Record\nA980\u2013A982. Before this Court, however, the City con\u00ad\ntends that Hemi made affirmative misrepresentations to\nCity residents, which, the City now argues, comprise part\nof the RICO predicate mail and wire frauds. See Brief for\nRespondent 42\u201343. The City\u2019s counsel pressed the point at\noral argument, asserting that the City\u2019s injury was\n\u201ccaused by the seller\u2019s misrepresentation, which encour\u00ad\nages the purchasers not to pay taxes.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\n  The City, however, affirmatively disavowed below any\nreliance on misrepresentations to form the predicate RICO\nviolation. The alleged false statements, the City there\nstated, \u201care evidence of the scheme to defraud, but are not\npart of the fraud itself. . . . [T]he scheme to defraud would\nexist even absent the statements.\u201d Record A980. The City\nreiterated the point: \u201cThe scheme consists of the interstate\nsale of cigarettes and the failure to file Jenkins Act reports\nindentifying those sales.\u201d Ibid. \u201cRelated to the fraud, but\nnot a circumstance \u2018constituting\u2019 the fraud, the defendants\ninform customers that [their] purchases will be concealed,\nand also seek to convince their customers that no taxes are\nowed by claiming, falsely, that the sales are tax-free.\u201d Id.,\nat A982. Not only did the City disclaim any reliance upon\nmisrepresentations to the customers to form the predicate\nacts under RICO, but the City made clear in its second\namended complaint that its two RICO claims rested solely\non the Jenkins Act violations as the predicate acts. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndevice would be available not only to the State, to which the reports\n\nwere due, but also to the City, to which Hemi owed no duty under the \n\nAct and to which it owed no taxes.\n\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Because the City\ndefined the predicate act before the District Court as\nHemi\u2019s failure to file the Jenkins Act reports, and ex\u00ad\npressly disavowed reliance on the alleged misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions themselves as predicate acts, we decline to consider\nHemi\u2019s alleged misstatements as predicate acts at this late\nstage.\n                          *     *    *\n   It bears remembering what this case is about. It is\nabout the RICO liability of a company for lost taxes it had\nno obligation to collect, remit, or pay, which harmed a\nparty to whom it owed no duty. It is about imposing such\nliability to substitute for or complement a governing body\u2019s\nuncertain ability or desire to collect taxes directly from\nthose who owe them. And it is about the fact that the\nliability comes with treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees\nattached. This Court has interpreted RICO broadly,\nconsistent with its terms, but we have also held that its\nreach is limited by the \u201crequirement of a direct causal\nconnection\u201d between the predicate wrong and the harm.\nAnza, 547 U. S., at 460. The City\u2019s injuries here were not\ncaused directly by the alleged fraud, and thus were not\ncaused \u201cby reason of\u201d it. The City, therefore, has no RICO\nclaim.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

As\nthe majority points out, ante, at 3, the Racketeer Influ\u00ad\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71961\u20131968, provides a private cause of action (and\ntreble damages) to \u201c[a]ny person injured in\u201d that person\u2019s\n\u201cbusiness or property by reason of\u201d conduct that involves a\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71964(c) (emphasis\nadded), 1962. RICO defines \u201cracketeering activity\u201d to\ninclude violations of various predicate criminal statutes\nincluding mail and wire fraud. \u00a71961(1). The \u201cpattern of\nracketeering\u201d at issue here consists of repeated instances\nof mail fraud, which in turn consist largely of violations of\nthe federal Jenkins Act, 15 U. S.

The violations consist of Hemi\u2019s intentional\nfailure to do so.\n  As the majority points out, we must assume for present\npurposes that an intentional failure to file Jenkins Act\nreports counts as mail fraud (at least where the failure is\npart of a scheme that includes use of the mails). Ante, at\n4. Lower courts have sometimes so held. See United\nStates v. Melvin, 544 F. 2d 767, 773\u2013777 (CA5 1977);\nUnited States v. Brewer, 528 F. 2d 492, 497\u2013498 (CA4\n1975). The Court of Appeals here so held. City of New\nYork v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., 541 F. 3d 425, 446 (CA2\n2008).

New York State (or State) and New York City (or City)\n     both impose tobacco taxes on New York cigarette buy\u00ad\n     ers. Second Am. Compl. \u00b637.\n  2. Both City and State normally collect the taxes from\n     in-state cigarette sellers, who, in turn, charge retail\n     customers. Id., \u00b6\u00b64, 6.\n  3. Hemi, an out-of-state company, sells cigarettes over\n     the Internet to in-state buyers at prices that are lower\n     than in-state cigarette prices. The difference in price\n     is almost entirely attributable to the fact that Hemi\u2019s\n     prices do not include any charge for New York taxes.\n     Hemi advertises its cigarettes as \u201ctax free\u201d and often\n     adds that it \u201cdoes not report any sales activity to any\n     State taxing authority.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b62, 6, 108b (internal\n     quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).\n  4. New York State normally receives Jenkins Act reports\n     from out-of-state sellers. It is contractually obliged to\n     pass the information on to New York City (and I as\u00ad\n     sume it normally does so). Id., \u00b6\u00b68\u20139, 11, 54\u201357.\n  5. When it receives Jenkins-Act-type information, New\n     York City writes letters to resident customers asking\n     them to pay the tobacco tax they owe. As a result,\n     New York City collects about 40% of the tax due. (By\n     doing so, in 2005 the City obtained $400,000 out of $1\n     million owed.) Id., \u00b6\u00b658\u201359.\n  6. Hemi has consistently and intentionally failed to file\n     Jenkins Act reports in order to prevent both State and\n     City from collecting the tobacco taxes that Hemi\u2019s in\u00ad\n     state customers owe and which otherwise many of\n     those customers would pay.

The\nfacts just set forth make clear that we must answer that\nquestion affirmatively. For one thing, no one denies that\nHemi\u2019s misrepresentation was a \u201cbut-for\u201d condition of New\nYork City\u2019s loss. In the absence of the misrepresentation,\ni.e., had Hemi told New York State the truth about its\nNew York City customers, New York City would have\nwritten letters to the purchasers and obtained a signifi\u00ad\ncant share of the tobacco taxes buyers owed.\n   For another thing, New York City\u2019s losses are \u201creasona\u00ad\nbly foreseeable\u201d results of the misrepresentation. It is\nforeseeable that, without the name/address/purchase\ninformation, New York City would not be able to write\nsuccessful dunning letters, and it is foreseeable that, with\nthat information, it would be able to write successful\ndunning letters. Indeed, that is a natural inference from,\namong other things, the complaint\u2019s assertion that Hemi\nadvertised that it did not \u201creport\u201d sales information to\n\u201cState taxing authorit[ies].\u201d See, e.g., Smith v. Bolles, 132\nU.

Holmes v. Securities\nInvestor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 267, 268\n(1992). I can find no antitrust analogy that suggests any\nlack of causation here, nor has the majority referred to\nany such analogical antitrust circumstance.\n  The upshot is that the harm is foreseeable; it is a conse\u00ad\nquence that Hemi intended, indeed desired; and it falls\nwell within the set of risks that Congress sought to pre\u00ad\nvent. Neither antitrust analogy nor any statutory policy of\nwhich I am aware precludes a finding of \u201cproximate\ncause.\u201d I recognize that some of our opinions may be read\nto suggest that the words \u201cby reason of\u201d in RICO do not\nperfectly track common-law notions of proximate cause.\nSee, e.g., Bridge, 553 U.

In my view, none of the three circumstances\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprecludes finding causation (indeed two are not even\nrelevant to the causation issue). Nor can I find the two\nprior cases controlling.\n   The three circumstances are the following: First, the\nmajority seems to argue that the intervening voluntary\nacts of third parties, namely, the customers\u2019 own inde\u00ad\npendent failures to pay the tax, cuts the causal chain.\nAnte, at 8 (\u201c[T]he City\u2019s harm was directly caused by the\ncustomers, not Hemi\u201d); see Saugerties Bank v. Delaware &\nHudson Co., 236 N. Y. 425, 430, 141 N. E. 904, 905 (1923)\n(third party\u2019s forgery of a bill of lading an intervening\ncause); Prosser and Keeton \u00a744, at 313\u2013314 (collecting\ncases on intervening intentional or criminal acts). But an\nintervening third-party act, even if criminal, does not cut a\ncausal chain where the intervening act is foreseeable and\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct increases the risk of its occur\u00ad\nrence. See Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, 462 (1947)\n(per curiam); Horan v. Watertown, 217 Mass. 185, 186, 104\nN. E. 464, 465 (1914); see also Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7435A, at 454 (1963\u20131964) (intentional tortfeasor\nliable for intended harm \u201cexcept where the harm results\nfrom an outside force the risk of which is not increased by\nthe defendant\u2019s act\u201d). Hemi\u2019s act here did increase the\nrisk that New York City would not be paid; and not only\nwas the risk foreseeable, but Hemi\u2019s advertising strongly\nsuggests that Hemi actually knew nonreporting would\nlikely bring about this very harm.\n   The majority claims that \u201cdirectness,\u201d rather than fore\u00ad\nseeability, should be our guide in assessing proximate\ncause, and that the lack of a \u201cdirect\u201d relationship in this\ncase precludes a finding of proximate causation. Ante, at\n9\u201310. But courts used this concept of directness in tort\nlaw to expand liability (for direct consequences) beyond\nwhat was foreseeable, not to eliminate liability for what\nwas foreseeable. Thus, under the \u201cdirectness\u201d theory of\nproximate causation, there is liability for both \u201call \u2018direct\u2019\n\f8         HEMI GROUP, LLC v.

S. 451\n(2006), to invoke anything other than this traditional\nunderstanding.\n   Second, the majority correctly points out that Hemi\nmisrepresented the situation to the State, not to the\nCity\u2014a circumstance which, the majority believes, signifi\u00ad\ncantly separates misrepresentation from harm. Ante, at 8.\nBut how could that be so? New York State signed a con\u00ad\ntract promising to relay relevant information to the City.\nIn respect to that relevant information, the State is a\nconduit, indeed roughly analogous to a postal employee.\nThis Court has recognized specifically that \u201cunder the\ncommon law a fraud may be established when the defen\u00ad\ndant has made use of a third party to reach the target of\nthe fraud.\u201d Tanner v. United States, 483 U. S. 107, 129\n(1987). The treatises say the same. See, e.g., Prosser and\nKeeton \u00a7107, at 743\u2013745; 26 C. J. S., Fraud \u00a747, p. 1121\n(1921) (collecting cases); see also Prosser, Misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion and Third Parties, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 231, 240\u2013241,\nand nn. 56\u201359, 62\u201364 (1966) (collecting cases). This Court\nhas never suggested the contrary, namely, that a defen\u00ad\ndant is not liable for (foreseeable) harm (intentionally)\ncaused to the target of a scheme to defraud simply because\nthe misrepresentation was transmitted via a third (or even\na fourth or fifth) party. Cf. Terry, Intent to Defraud, 25\nYale L. J. 87, 93 (1915) (\u201cWhen a representation is com\u00ad\nmunicated through one person to another in such circum\u00ad\nstances that it can be deemed to be directed to the latter,\nit makes no difference through how many persons or by\nhow circuitous a route it reaches the latter . . .\u201d).\n   Third, the majority places great weight upon its view\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

Hemi sought to\nprevent the State from collecting state taxes; and it sought\nto prevent the City from collecting city taxes. Here we are\nconcerned only with the latter. In respect to the latter, the\nState was an information conduit. The fact that state\ntaxes were also involved is beside the point.\n   The two Supreme Court cases to which the majority\nrefers involve significantly different causal circumstances.\nAnte, at 5\u20138. The predicate acts in Holmes\u2014the defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s acts that led to the plaintiff\u2019s harm\u2014consisted of\nsecurities frauds. The defendant misrepresented the\nprospects of one company and misled the investing public\ninto falsely believing that it could readily buy and sell the\nstock of another. When the truth came out, stock prices\nfell, investors (specifically, stockbrokers) lost money, and\nsince the stockbrokers could not pay certain creditors,\nthose creditors also lost money. 503 U. S., at 262\u2013263.\nClaiming subrogation to stand in the shoes of the credi\u00ad\ntors, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation sued.\nId., at 270\u2013271.\n   Since the creditors had not bought the securities, there\nwas little reason to believe the defendant intended their\nharm. And the securities statutes seek, first and foremost,\nto protect investors, not creditors of those who sell stock to\nthose investors. The latter harm (a broker\u2019s creditor\u2019s\nloss) differs in kind from the harm that the \u201cpredicate act\u201d\nstatute primarily seeks to avoid and that its violation\nwould ordinarily cause (namely, investors\u2019 stock-related\nmonetary losses). As Part II\u2013A, supra, points out, neither\nof these circumstances is present here.\n   In Anza, the plaintiff was a business competitor of the\n\f10         HEMI GROUP, LLC v. CITY OF NEW YORK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndefendants. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants\nfalsely told state officials that they did not owe sales tax.\nThe plaintiff added that, had the defendants paid the tax\nthey owed, the defendants would have had less money\navailable to run their business, and the plaintiff conse\u00ad\nquently would have been able to compete against them\nmore effectively. 547 U. S., at 454, 457\u2013458.\n   Again, in Anza the kind of harm that the plaintiff al\u00ad\nleged is not the kind of harm that the tax statutes primar\u00ad\nily seek to prevent. Rather, it alleged a kind of harm\n(competitive injury) that tax violations do not ordinarily\ncause and which ordinarily flows from the regular opera\u00ad\ntion of a competitive marketplace. Thus, in both Holmes\nand Anza, unlike the present case, plaintiffs alleged spe\u00ad\ncial harm, neither squarely within the class of harms at\nwhich the relevant statutes were directed, nor of a kind\nthat typical violators would intend or even foresee.\n   Bridge, which the majority seeks to distinguish, ante, at\n11\u201312, is a more closely analogous case. The defendants\nin that case directed agents to misrepresent to a county\nthat they qualified as independent bidders at a county-run\nproperty auction. They consequently participated in the\nauction. And the plaintiffs, facing additional bidders, lost\nsome of the property that they otherwise would have\nwon\u2014all to their financial disadvantage. 553 U. S., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20134). The harm was foreseeable; it\nwas intended; and it was precisely the kind of harm that\nthe county\u2019s bidding rules sought to prevent. Thus this\nCourt held that the harm was \u201ca foreseeable and natural\nconsequence of [the defendants\u2019] scheme.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18).\n   In sum, the majority recognizes that \u201c[p]roximate cause\nfor RICO purposes . . . should be evaluated in light of its\ncommon law foundations,\u201d ante, at 6, but those founda\u00ad\ntions do not support the majority\u2019s view.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Salmonese, 352 F. 3d 608, 612 (CA2\n2003). They deliberately and repeatedly make egregiously\nfraudulent misrepresentations to inflate the price of secu\u00ad\nrities that, unbeknownst to investors, they own. After the\nstock price rises, the defendants sell at an artificial profit.\nWhen the fraud is revealed, the price crashes, to the inves\u00ad\ntors\u2019 detriment. Suppose the defendants have intention\u00ad\nally spoken directly only to intermediaries who simply\nrepeated the information to potential investors, and have\nnot had any contact with the investors themselves. Under\nthe majority\u2019s reasoning, these defendants apparently did\nnot proximately cause the investors\u2019 losses and are not\nliable under RICO.\n                             III\n   If there is causation, we must decide whether, for RICO\npurposes, the City\u2019s loss of tax revenue is \u201c \u2018business or\nproperty\u2019 under 18 U.

And limiting my consideration to these circum\u00ad\nstances, I would find that this RICO complaint asserts a\nvalid harm to \u201cbusiness or property.\u201d I need not and do\nnot express a view as to how or whether RICO\u2019s civil\naction provisions apply to simpler instances of individual\ntax liability.\n   This conclusion is virtually compelled by Pasquantino v.\nUnited States, 544 U. S. 349 (2005), a case that we decided\nonly five years ago. We there pointed out that the right to\nuncollected taxes is an \u201centitlement to collect money . . . ,\nthe possession of which is \u2018something of value.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Such an entitlement \u201chas long been thought to be\na species of property.\u201d 544 U. S., at 356 (citing 3 W. Black\u00ad\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153\u2013155\n(1768)). And \u201cfraud at common law included a scheme to\ndeprive a victim of his entitlement to money.\u201d 544 U. S.,\nat 356.

Hawaii\u2019s inter\u00ad\nest, both more general and derivative of harm to individ\u00ad\nual businesses, differs significantly from the particular tax\nloss at issue in Pasquantino and directly at issue here.\n   We have previously made clear that the compensable\ninjury for RICO purposes is the harm caused by the predi\u00ad\ncate acts. See generally Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co.,\n473 U. S. 479, 495\u2013496 (1985); cf. Cleveland v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000). I can find no convincing\nreason in the context of this case to distinguish in the\ncircumstances present here between \u201cproperty\u201d as used in\nthe mail fraud statute and \u201cproperty\u201d as used in RICO.\nHence, I would postpone for another day the question\nwhether RICO covers instances where little more than the\nliability of an individual taxpayer is at issue. And I would\nfind in the respondent\u2019s favor here.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n\f"}

Argued March 24, 2009\u2014Reargued September 9, 2009\u2013\u2013\r\n                        Decided January 21, 2010\r\nAs amended by \u00a7203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\r\n  (BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using\r\n  their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for\r\n  speech that is an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d or for speech that\r\n  expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C.\r\n  \u00a7441b. An electioneering communication is \u201cany broadcast, cable, or\r\n  satellite communication\u201d that \u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate\r\n  for Federal office\u201d and is made within 30 days of a primary election,\r\n  \u00a7434(f)(3)(A), and that is \u201cpublicly distributed,\u201d 11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2),\r\n  which in \u201cthe case of a candidate for nomination for President . . .\r\n  means\u201d that the communication \u201c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more\r\n  persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within\r\n  30 days,\u201d \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions may establish a\r\n  political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneer\r\n  ing communications purposes. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b(b)(2). In McConnell\r\n  v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 203\u2013209, this Court upheld\r\n  limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying\r\n  on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494\r\n  U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker\u2019s\r\n  corporate identity.\r\n     In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corpora\r\n  tion, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of then-\r\n  Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party\u2019s Presidential\r\n  nomination. Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on\r\n  cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary\r\n  elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast\r\n\f2        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    and cable television. Concerned about possible civil and criminal\r\n    penalties for violating \u00a7441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive re\r\n    lief, arguing that (1) \u00a7441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary;\r\n    and (2) BCRA\u2019s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements,\r\n    BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to Hillary\r\n    and the ads. The District Court denied Citizens United a prelimi\r\n    nary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission\r\n    (FEC) summary judgment.\r\nHeld:\r\n    1. Because the question whether \u00a7441b applies to Hillary cannot be\r\n resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech,\r\n this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppres\r\n sion upheld in Austin. Pp. 5\u201320.\r\n       (a) Citizen United\u2019s narrower arguments\u2014that Hillary is not an\r\n \u201celectioneering communication\u201d covered by \u00a7441b because it is not\r\n \u201cpublicly distributed\u201d under 11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2); that \u00a7441b may\r\n not be applied to Hillary under Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin\r\n Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (WRTL), which found \u00a7441b uncon\r\n stitutional as applied to speech that was not \u201cexpress advocacy or its\r\n functional equivalent,\u201d id., at 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), deter\r\n mining that a communication \u201cis the functional equivalent of express\r\n advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation\r\n other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,\u201d\r\n id., at 469\u2013470; that \u00a7441b should be invalidated as applied to movies\r\n shown through video-on-demand because this delivery system has a\r\n lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads;\r\n and that there should be an exception to \u00a7441b\u2019s ban for nonprofit\r\n corporate political speech funded overwhelming by individuals\u2014are\r\n not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. Pp. 5\u201312.\r\n       (b) Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground\r\n without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the First\r\n Amendment\u2019s meaning and purpose. Citizens United did not waive\r\n this challenge to Austin when it stipulated to dismissing the facial\r\n challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived,\r\n this Court may reconsider Austin and \u00a7441b\u2019s facial validity here be\r\n cause the District Court \u201cpassed upon\u201d the issue, Lebron v. National\r\n Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379; (2) throughout\r\n the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has\r\n violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into\r\n a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies nec\r\n essary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Because Citizen\r\n United\u2019s narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in\r\n an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider \u00a7441b\u2019s facial valid\r\n ity. Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide\r\n\f                   Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nchilling effect caused by \u00a7441b\u2019s corporate expenditure ban. This\r\nconclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty\r\ncaused by the Government\u2019s litigating position; (2) substantial time\r\nwould be required to clarify \u00a7441b\u2019s application on the points raised\r\nby the Government\u2019s position in order to avoid any chilling effect\r\ncaused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is\r\nof primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any\r\nspeech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating po\r\nlitical speech is chilled. The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a\r\nprior restraint in the strict sense. However, given its complexity and\r\nthe deference courts show to administrative determinations, a\r\nspeaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy\r\ncosts of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmen\r\ntal agency for prior permission to speak. The restrictions thus func\r\ntion as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power\r\nanalogous to the type of government practices that the First Amend\r\nment was drawn to prohibit. The ongoing chill on speech makes it\r\nnecessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills\r\nspeech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has\r\nbeen demonstrated. Pp. 12\u201320.\r\n   2. Austin is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the\r\nGovernment to limit corporate independent expenditures. Hence,\r\n\u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be\r\napplied to Hillary. Given this conclusion, the part of McConnell that\r\nupheld BCRA \u00a7203\u2019s extension of \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on independent\r\ncorporate expenditures is also overruled. Pp. 20\u201351.\r\n      (a) Although the First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall\r\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech,\u201d \u00a7441b\u2019s prohibition\r\non corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech,\r\nbacked by criminal sanctions. It is a ban notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a\r\nseparate association from the corporation. Because speech is an es\r\nsential mechanism of democracy\u2014it is the means to hold officials ac\r\ncountable to the people\u2014political speech must prevail against laws\r\nthat would suppress it by design or inadvertence. Laws burdening\r\nsuch speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Gov\r\nernment to prove that the restriction \u201cfurthers a compelling interest\r\nand is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\u201d WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 464. This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting\r\nthe interests in this case. Premised on mistrust of governmental\r\npower, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor cer\r\ntain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speak\r\ners, which may be a means to control content. The Government may\r\nalso commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain\r\n\f4        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    preferred speakers. There is no basis for the proposition that, in the\r\n    political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on\r\n    certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead to this con\r\n    clusion. Pp. 20\u201325.\r\n         (b) The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies\r\n    to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n    765, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political\r\n    speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428\u2013429. Address\r\n    ing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the\r\n    Buckley Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18\r\n    U. S. C. \u00a7608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing\r\n    quid pro quo corruption. 424 U. S., at 25\u201326. However, the Court in\r\n    validated \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals,\r\n    corporations, and unions, because it \u201cfail[ed] to serve any substantial\r\n    governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of cor\r\n    ruption in the electoral process,\u201d id., at 47\u201348. While Buckley did not\r\n    consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expendi\r\n    tures found in \u00a7610, had that provision been challenged in Buckley\u2019s\r\n    wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent\u2019s reasoning\r\n    and analysis. The Buckley Court did not invoke the overbreadth doc\r\n    trine to suggest that \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure ban would have been con\r\n    stitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not indi\r\n    viduals. Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified\r\n    \u00a7610\u2019s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b, the\r\n    provision at issue. Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaf\r\n    firmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the\r\n    power to restrict political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate\r\n    identity. 435 U.S., at 784\u2013785. Thus the law stood until Austin up\r\n    held a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing\r\n    Buckley and Bellotti by recognizing a new governmental interest in\r\n    preventing \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggrega\r\n    tions of [corporate] wealth . . . that have little or no correlation to the\r\n    public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d 494 U. S., at\r\n    660. Pp. 25\u201332.\r\n         (c) This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a\r\n    pre-Austin line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker\u2019s\r\n    corporate identity and a post-Austin line permitting them. Neither\r\n    Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale nor the Government\u2019s other justifica\r\n    tions support \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions. Pp. 32\u201347.\r\n            (1) The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or\r\n    jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political\r\n    speech, but Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale would permit the Gov\r\n    ernment to ban political speech because the speaker is an association\r\n    with a corporate form. Political speech is \u201cindispensable to decision\r\n\f                   Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 659. First Amendment protec\r\ntions do not depend on the speaker\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability to engage in\r\npublic discussion.\u201d Buckley, supra, at 49. These conclusions were re\r\naffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that in\r\ncreased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent\r\nmade certain expenditures from personal funds. Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Distinguishing wealthy indi\r\nviduals from corporations based on the latter\u2019s special advantages of,\r\ne.g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting\r\nspeech. It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate\r\nfunds may \u201chave little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the\r\ncorporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d Austin, supra, at 660. All speakers, in\r\ncluding individuals and the media, use money amassed from the eco\r\nnomic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment\r\nprotects the resulting speech. Under the antidistortion rationale,\r\nCongress could also ban political speech of media corporations. Al\r\nthough currently exempt from \u00a7441b, they accumulate wealth with\r\nthe help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth,\r\nand may express views \u201chav[ing] little or no correlation to the public\u2019s\r\nsupport\u201d for those views. Differential treatment of media corpora\r\ntions and other corporations cannot be squared with the First\r\nAmendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amend\r\nment\u2019s original meaning would permit suppressing media corpora\r\ntions\u2019 political speech. Austin interferes with the \u201copen marketplace\u201d\r\nof ideas protected by the First Amendment. New York State Bd. of\r\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208. Its censorship is vast in\r\nits reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit,\r\nboth small and large, corporations. Pp. 32\u201340.\r\n        (2) This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Govern\r\nment\u2019s other arguments. It reasons that corporate political speech\r\ncan be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance. The Buckley\r\nCourt found this rationale \u201csufficiently important\u201d to allow contribu\r\ntion limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits,\r\n424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here. While a single\r\nBellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at\r\n788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures,\r\nincluding those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption\r\nor the appearance of corruption. That speakers may have influence\r\nover or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials\r\n\f6        CITIZENS UNITED v.

And the appearance of influence or access will not cause\r\n    the electorate to lose faith in this democracy. Caperton v. A. T.\r\n    Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished. Pp. 40\u201345.\r\n             (3) The Government\u2019s asserted interest in protecting share\r\n    holders from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the anti\r\n    distortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political\r\n    speech even of media corporations. The statute is underinclusive; it\r\n    only protects a dissenting shareholder\u2019s interests in certain media for\r\n    30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be impli\r\n    cated in any media at any time. It is also overinclusive because it\r\n    covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder. P. 46.\r\n               (4) Because \u00a7441b is not limited to corporations or associa\r\n    tions created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign\r\n    shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recog\r\n    nize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence\r\n    over the Nation\u2019s political process. Pp. 46\u201347.\r\n          (d) The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare\r\n    decisis, beyond workability\u2014the precedent\u2019s antiquity, the reliance\r\n    interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned\u2014\r\n    counsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the\r\n    precedents of Buckley and Bellotti. As already explained, Austin was\r\n    not well reasoned. It is also undermined by experience since its an\r\n    nouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in this country\u2019s culture\r\n    that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws. Rapid\r\n    changes in technology\u2014and the creative dynamic inherent in the\r\n    concept of free expression\u2014counsel against upholding a law that re\r\n    stricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. In\r\n    addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake. Thus, due consid\r\n    eration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled. The\r\n    Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that\r\n    the Government may not suppress political speech based on the\r\n    speaker\u2019s corporate identity.

The Buckley Court explained that\r\n    disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing\r\n    \u201cthe electorate with information\u201d about election-related spending\r\n    sources. The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial\r\n    challenges to \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. However, the Court\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Pp. 50\u201352.\r\n       (b) The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as ap\r\n  plied to Citizens United\u2019s ads. They fall within BCRA\u2019s \u201celectioneer\r\n  ing communication\u201d definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton\r\n  by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references\r\n  to her candidacy. Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the\r\n  electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and \u201cinsure that the voters are\r\n  fully informed\u201d about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76. At the\r\n  very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not\r\n  funded by a candidate or political party. Citizens United\u2019s arguments\r\n  that \u00a7311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broad\r\n  cast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that\r\n  \u00a7311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group\u2019s speech\r\n  were rejected in McConnell. This Court also rejects their contention\r\n  that \u00a7201\u2019s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that\r\n  is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTL\u2019s test\r\n  for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469\u2013476\r\n  (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). Disclosure is the less-restrictive alterna\r\n  tive to more comprehensive speech regulations. Such requirements\r\n  have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell. Citizens United\u2019s ar\r\n  gument that no informational interest justifies applying \u00a7201 to its\r\n  ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to dis\r\n  claimers. Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements\r\n  can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no\r\n  evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or\r\n  reprisals that might make \u00a7201 unconstitutional as applied. Pp. 52\u2013\r\n  55.\r\n       (c) For these same reasons, this Court affirms the application of\r\n  the \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Hillary.\r\n  Pp. 55\u201356.\r\nReversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.\r\n\r\n   KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\r\nC.

The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent\r\non an earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Com\r\nmerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990). Austin had held that political\r\nspeech may be banned based on the speaker\u2019s corporate\r\nidentity.\r\n  In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in\r\neffect, McConnell. It has been noted that \u201cAustin was a\r\nsignificant departure from ancient First Amendment\r\nprinciples,\u201d Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to\r\nLife, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 490 (2007) (WRTL) (SCALIA, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). We agree\r\nwith that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not\r\ncompel the continued acceptance of Austin. The Govern\r\n\f2     CITIZENS UNITED v.

We turn to the case now\r\nbefore us.\r\n                               I\r\n\r\n                               A\r\n\r\n   Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It brought\r\nthis action in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. A three-judge court later convened\r\nto hear the cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to\r\nthis appeal.\r\n   Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12\r\nmillion. Most of its funds are from donations by individu\r\nals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds\r\nfrom for-profit corporations.\r\n   In January 2008, Citizens United released a film enti\r\ntled Hillary: The Movie. We refer to the film as Hillary. It\r\nis a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary\r\nClinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party\u2019s\r\n2008 Presidential primary elections. Hillary mentions\r\nSenator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with\r\npolitical commentators and other persons, most of them\r\nquite critical of Senator Clinton. Hillary was released in\r\ntheaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to\r\nincrease distribution by making it available through video\r\non-demand.\r\n   Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to\r\nselect programming from various menus, including mov\r\nies, television shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer\r\ncan watch the program at any time and can elect to re\r\nwind or pause the program. In December 2007, a cable\r\ncompany offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make\r\nHillary available on a video-on-demand channel called\r\n\u201cElections \u201908.\u201d App. 255a\u2013257a.

Each ad includes a short (and, in our view,\r\npejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by\r\nthe name of the movie and the movie\u2019s Website address.\r\nId., at 26a\u201327a. Citizens United desired to promote the\r\nvideo-on-demand offering by running advertisements on\r\nbroadcast and cable television.\r\n                              B\r\n   Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\r\n(BCRA), federal law prohibited\u2014and still does prohibit\u2014\r\ncorporations and unions from using general treasury\r\nfunds to make direct contributions to candidates or inde\r\npendent expenditures that expressly advocate the election\r\nor defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in\r\nconnection with certain qualified federal elections. 2\r\nU. S. C. \u00a7441b (2000 ed.); see McConnell, supra, at 204,\r\nand n. 87; Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Massachusetts\r\nCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 249 (1986) (MCFL).\r\nBCRA \u00a7203 amended \u00a7441b to prohibit any \u201celectioneering\r\ncommunication\u201d as well. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.).\r\nAn electioneering communication is defined as \u201cany broad\r\ncast, cable, or satellite communication\u201d that \u201crefers to a\r\nclearly identified candidate for Federal office\u201d and is made\r\nwithin 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general elec\r\ntion. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A). The Federal Election Commission\u2019s\r\n(FEC) regulations further define an electioneering com\r\nmunication as a communication that is \u201cpublicly distrib\r\nuted.\u201d 11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2) (2009). \u201cIn the case of a\r\ncandidate for nomination for President . . . publicly dis\r\ntributed means\u201d that the communication \u201c[c]an be received\r\nby 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary\r\n\f4     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Corporations and unions are barred from\r\nusing their general treasury funds for express advocacy or\r\nelectioneering communications.      They may establish,\r\nhowever, a \u201cseparate segregated fund\u201d (known as a politi\r\ncal action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2\r\nU. S. C. \u00a7441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segre\r\ngated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and\r\nemployees of the corporation or, in the case of unions,\r\nmembers of the union. Ibid.\r\n                              C\r\n   Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available\r\nthrough video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008\r\nprimary elections. It feared, however, that both the film\r\nand the ads would be covered by \u00a7441b\u2019s ban on corporate\r\nfunded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the\r\ncorporation to civil and criminal penalties under \u00a7437g. In\r\nDecember 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and\r\ninjunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) \u00a7441b\r\nis unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA\u2019s\r\ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and\r\n311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the\r\nthree ads for the movie.\r\n   The District Court denied Citizens United\u2019s motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (DC 2008)\r\n(per curiam), and then granted the FEC\u2019s motion for\r\nsummary judgment, App. 261a\u2013262a.

The court held that \u00a7441b was facially\r\nconstitutional under McConnell, and that \u00a7441b was\r\nconstitutional as applied to Hillary because it was \u201csus\r\nceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

C. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A)(i).\r\nCitizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not\r\n\u201cpublicly distributed,\u201d because a single video-on-demand\r\ntransmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter\r\nbox and each separate transmission, in most instances,\r\nwill be seen by just one household\u2014not 50,000 or more\r\npersons. 11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2); see \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii).\r\n   This argument ignores the regulation\u2019s instruction on\r\nhow to determine whether a cable transmission \u201c[c]an be\r\nreceived by 50,000 or more persons.\u201d \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii).\r\nThe regulation provides that the number of people who\r\ncan receive a cable transmission is determined by the\r\nnumber of cable subscribers in the relevant area.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to\r\nuse a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million\r\nsubscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, Hillary could\r\nhave been received by 50,000 persons or more.\r\n   One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the\r\ncondition that the communication \u201c[c]an be received by\r\n50,000 or more persons,\u201d \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require \u201ca\r\nplausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed\r\nby 50,000 or more potential voters\u201d\u2014as opposed to requir\r\ning only that the communication is \u201ctechnologically capa\r\nble\u201d of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former\r\nOfficials of the American Civil Liberties Union as Amici\r\nCuriae 5. Whether the population and demographic sta\r\ntistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000\r\nregistered voters\u2014but not \u201cinfants, pre-teens, or otherwise\r\nelectorally ineligible recipients\u201d\u2014would be a required\r\ndetermination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in\r\nany case where the issue was in doubt. Id., at 6.\r\n   In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the\r\nreach of 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b through this suggested interpre\r\ntation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation,\r\nthis result would require a calculation as to the number of\r\npeople a particular communication is likely to reach, with\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

The First Amendment does not\r\npermit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign\r\nfinance attorney, conduct demographic marketing re\r\nsearch, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the\r\nmost salient political issues of our day.

We must reject\r\nthe approach suggested by the amici. Section 441b covers\r\nHillary.\r\n                              B\r\n   Citizens United next argues that \u00a7441b may not be\r\napplied to Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.\r\nMcConnell decided that \u00a7441b(b)(2)\u2019s definition of an\r\n\u201celectioneering communication\u201d was facially constitutional\r\ninsofar as it restricted speech that was \u201cthe functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy\u201d for or against a specific\r\ncandidate. 540 U. S., at 206. WRTL then found an uncon\r\nstitutional application of \u00a7441b where the speech was not\r\n\u201cexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.\u201d 551 U. S.,\r\nat 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). As explained by THE\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s controlling opinion in WRTL, the func\r\ntional-equivalent test is objective: \u201ca court should find that\r\n[a communication] is the functional equivalent of express\r\nadvocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable inter\r\npretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a\r\nspecific candidate.\u201d Id., at 469\u2013470.\r\n   Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advo\r\ncacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative\r\nadvertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator\r\n\f8     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nClinton for President. In light of historical footage, inter\r\nviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration,\r\nthe film would be understood by most viewers as an ex\r\ntended criticism of Senator Clinton\u2019s character and her\r\nfitness for the office of the Presidency. The narrative may\r\ncontain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but\r\nthere is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is\r\nunfit for the Presidency. The movie concentrates on al\r\nleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration,\r\nSenator Clinton\u2019s qualifications and fitness for office, and\r\npolicies the commentators predict she would pursue if\r\nelected President. It calls Senator Clinton \u201cMachiavel\r\nlian,\u201d App. 64a, and asks whether she is \u201cthe most quali\r\nfied to hit the ground running if elected President,\u201d id., at\r\n88a. The narrator reminds viewers that \u201cAmericans have\r\nnever been keen on dynasties\u201d and that \u201ca vote for Hillary\r\nis a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the\r\nWhite House,\u201d id., at 143a\u2013144a.\r\n   Citizens United argues that Hillary is just \u201ca documen\r\ntary film that examines certain historical events.\u201d Brief\r\nfor Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie\u2019s consistent\r\nemphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator\r\nClinton\u2019s candidacy for President. The narrator begins by\r\nasking \u201ccould [Senator Clinton] become the first female\r\nPresident in the history of the United States?\u201d App. 35a.\r\nAnd the narrator reiterates the movie\u2019s message in his\r\nclosing line: \u201cFinally, before America decides on our next\r\npresident, voters should need no reminders of . . . what\u2019s\r\nat stake\u2014the well being and prosperity of our nation.\u201d\r\nId., at 144a\u2013145a.\r\n   As the District Court found, there is no reasonable\r\ninterpretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote\r\nagainst Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in\r\nMcConnell and further elaborated in WRTL, the film\r\nqualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

Cf. McConnell, supra, at 207. On what we might call\r\nconventional television, advertising spots reach viewers\r\nwho have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unre\r\nlated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by con\r\ntrast, the viewer selects a program after taking \u201ca series of\r\naffirmative steps\u201d: subscribing to cable; navigating\r\nthrough various menus; and selecting the program. See\r\nReno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867\r\n(1997).\r\n   While some means of communication may be less effec\r\ntive than others at influencing the public in different\r\ncontexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which\r\nmeans of communications are to be preferred for the par\r\nticular type of message and speaker would raise questions\r\nas to the courts\u2019 own lawful authority. Substantial ques\r\ntions would arise if courts were to begin saying what\r\nmeans of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in\r\nall events, those differentiations might soon prove to be\r\nirrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid\r\nflux. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512\r\nU.

We\r\nmust decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional\r\nlines based on the particular media or technology used to\r\ndisseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It\r\nmust be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would\r\nrequire substantial litigation over an extended time, all to\r\ninterpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First\r\nAmendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would\r\ncreate an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling\r\nprotected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions\r\n\f10    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthat, in the end, would themselves be questionable. First\r\nAmendment standards, however, \u201cmust give the benefit of\r\nany doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\u201d\r\nWRTL, 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing\r\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269\u2013270\r\n(1964)).\r\n                              D\r\n  Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to\r\n\u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political\r\nspeech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an\r\nalternative to reconsidering Austin, the Government also\r\nseems to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, how\r\never, would be unavailing.\r\n  In MCFL, the Court found unconstitutional \u00a7441b\u2019s\r\nrestrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to non\r\nprofit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose\r\nof promoting political ideas, did not engage in business\r\nactivities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit\r\ncorporations or labor unions. 479 U. S., at 263\u2013264; see\r\nalso 11 CFR \u00a7114.10. BCRA\u2019s so-called Wellstone Amend\r\nment applied \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban to all nonprofit\r\ncorporations. See 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b(c)(6); McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 209. McConnell then interpreted the Wellstone\r\nAmendment to retain the MCFL exemption to \u00a7441b\u2019s\r\nexpenditure prohibition. 540 U. S., at 211. Citizens\r\nUnited does not qualify for the MCFL exemption, however,\r\nsince some funds used to make the movie were donations\r\nfrom for-profit corporations.\r\n  The Government suggests we could find BCRA\u2019s\r\nWellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the\r\nstatute, and hold that Citizens United\u2019s speech is exempt\r\nfrom \u00a7441b\u2019s ban under BCRA\u2019s Snowe-Jeffords Amend\r\nment, \u00a7441b(c)(2). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338 (Sept. 9,\r\n2009). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a\r\nbackup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAmendment is invalidated. See McConnell, supra, at 339\r\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\r\ning in part). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would ex\r\nempt from \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban the political speech of\r\ncertain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded\r\n\u201cexclusively\u201d by individual donors and the funds were\r\nmaintained in a segregated account. \u00a7441b(c)(2). Citizens\r\nUnited would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemp\r\ntion, under its terms as written, because Hillary was\r\nfunded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.\r\n   Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argu\r\nment, the Court would be required to revise the text of\r\nMCFL, sever BCRA\u2019s Wellstone Amendment, \u00a7441b(c)(6),\r\nand ignore the plain text of BCRA\u2019s Snowe-Jeffords\r\nAmendment, \u00a7441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a\r\nde minimis exception to MCFL or the Snowe-Jeffords\r\nAmendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corpo\r\nrate general treasury funds to be spent for independent\r\nexpenditures that support candidates. There is no princi\r\npled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin\u2019s hold\r\ning that the Government can restrict corporate independ\r\nent expenditures for political speech.\r\n   Though it is true that the Court should construe stat\r\nutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the\r\nseries of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view\r\nof the language of the statute. In addition to those diffi\r\nculties the Government\u2019s suggestion is troubling for still\r\nanother reason. The Government does not say that it\r\nagrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider. See\r\nSupp. Brief for Appellee 3, n. 1 (\u201cSome courts\u201d have im\r\nplied a de minimis exception, and \u201cappellant would appear\r\nto be covered by these decisions\u201d). Presumably it would\r\nfind textual difficulties in this approach too. The Govern\r\nment, like any party, can make arguments in the alterna\r\ntive; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative\r\nproposal instead of merely suggesting it. This is especially\r\n\f12    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntrue in the context of the First Amendment. As the Gov\r\nernment stated, this case \u201cwould require a remand\u201d to\r\napply a de minimis standard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9,\r\n2009). Applying this standard would thus require case-by\r\ncase determinations. But archetypical political speech\r\nwould be chilled in the meantime. \u201c \u2018First Amendment\r\nfreedoms need breathing space to survive.\u2019 \u201d WRTL, supra,\r\nat 468\u2013469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting NAACP v.\r\nButton, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963)). We decline to adopt an\r\ninterpretation that requires intricate case-by-case deter\r\nminations to verify whether political speech is banned,\r\nespecially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corpo\r\nration has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.\r\n                             E\r\n   As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot\r\nresolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling\r\npolitical speech, speech that is central to the meaning and\r\npurpose of the First Amendment. See Morse v. Frederick,\r\n551 U. S. 393, 403 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to\r\naccept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can\r\navoid another argument with broader implications. In\r\ndeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties\r\nwere it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the\r\nnecessity of making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a\r\nvalid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consid\r\neration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression\r\nupheld in Austin.\r\n   Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its\r\ncomplaint, which raised a facial challenge to \u00a7441b, even\r\nthough count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App.\r\n23a (count 3: \u201cAs applied to Hillary, [\u00a7441b] is unconstitu\r\ntional under the First Amendment guarantees of free\r\nexpression and association\u201d). The Government argues\r\nthat Citizens United waived its challenge to Austin by\r\ndismissing count 5. We disagree.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial\r\nchallenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that\r\nwould not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or\r\naddressing the facial validity of \u00a7441b in this case. \u201cOur\r\npractice \u2018permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below]\r\nso long as it has been passed upon . . . .\u2019 \u201d Lebron, 513\r\nU. S., at 379 (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U. S.\r\n36, 41 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the\r\nDistrict Court addressed Citizens United\u2019s facial chal\r\nlenge. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (\u201cCitizens wants us to\r\nenjoin the operation of BCRA \u00a7203 as a facially unconsti\r\ntutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom\r\nof speech\u201d). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it \u201cwould\r\nhave to overrule McConnell\u201d for Citizens United to prevail\r\non its facial challenge and that \u201c[o]nly the Supreme Court\r\nmay overrule its decisions.\u201d Ibid. (citing Rodriguez de\r\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\r\n484 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much\r\nanalysis regarding the facial challenge because it could\r\nnot ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in\r\nAustin or McConnell. Even so, the District Court did\r\n\u201c \u2018pas[s] upon\u2019 \u201d the issue. Lebron, supra, at 379. Fur\r\nthermore, the District Court\u2019s later opinion, which granted\r\nthe FEC summary judgment, was \u201c[b]ased on the reason\r\ning of [its] prior opinion,\u201d which included the discussion of\r\nthe facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F. Supp. 2d\r\n274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity\r\nof the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to\r\nAustin in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (\u201cAustin\r\nwas wrongly decided and should be overruled\u201d); id., at 30\u2013\r\n32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider\r\nCitizens United\u2019s challenge to Austin and the facial valid\r\nity of \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban.\r\n   Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has\r\nasserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First\r\nAmendment right to free speech. All concede that this\r\n\f14    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nclaim is properly before us. And \u201c \u2018[o]nce a federal claim is\r\nproperly presented, a party can make any argument in\r\nsupport of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise\r\narguments they made below.\u2019 \u201d Lebron, supra, at 379\r\n(quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992);\r\nalteration in original). Citizens United\u2019s argument that\r\nAustin should be overruled is \u201cnot a new claim.\u201d Lebron,\r\n513 U. S., at 379. Rather, it is\u2014at most\u2014\u201ca new argu\r\nment to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that\r\n[the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it\r\nwas obliged to provide by the First Amendment.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied\r\nchallenges is not so well defined that it has some auto\r\nmatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings\r\nand disposition in every case involving a constitutional\r\nchallenge. The distinction is both instructive and neces\r\nsary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by\r\nthe Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint. See\r\nUnited States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 477\u2013\r\n478 (1995) (contrasting \u201ca facial challenge\u201d with \u201ca nar\r\nrower remedy\u201d). The parties cannot enter into a stipula\r\ntion that prevents the Court from considering certain\r\nremedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim\r\nthat has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved\r\nits First Amendment challenge to \u00a7441b as applied to the\r\nfacts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we can\r\nnot easily address that issue without assuming a prem\r\nise\u2014the permissibility of restricting corporate political\r\nspeech\u2014that is itself in doubt. See Fallon, As-Applied and\r\nFacial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv.\r\nL. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\u201c[O]nce a case is brought, no\r\ngeneral categorical line bars a court from making broader\r\npronouncements of invalidity in properly \u2018as-applied\u2019\r\ncases\u201d); id., at 1327\u20131328.

The holding\r\nand validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of\r\nthe McConnell majority opinion, which upheld BCRA\u2019s\r\nextension of \u00a7441b. See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin,\r\n494 U. S., at 660). McConnell permitted federal felony\r\npunishment for speech by all corporations, including\r\nnonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly\r\nbefore federal elections. See 540 U. S., at 203\u2013209. Four\r\nMembers of the McConnell Court would have overruled\r\nAustin, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined\r\nthe Court\u2019s opinion in Austin but reconsidered that conclu\r\nsion. See 540 U. S., at 256\u2013262 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\r\npart, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in\r\npart); id., at 273\u2013275 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part,\r\nconcurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in\r\npart, and dissenting in part); id., at 322\u2013338 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA, J.).\r\nThat inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was\r\nfacilitated by the extensive record, which was \u201cover\r\n100,000 pages\u201d long, made in the three-judge District\r\nCourt.     McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 251\r\nF. Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (McConnell\r\nI). It is not the case, then, that the Court today is prema\r\nture in interpreting \u00a7441b \u201c \u2018on the basis of [a] factually\r\nbarebones recor[d].\u2019 \u201d Washington State Grange v. Wash\r\nington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008)\r\n(quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)).\r\n   The McConnell majority considered whether the statute\r\nwas facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought\r\nin Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election\r\nComm\u2019n, 546 U. S. 410, 411\u2013412 (2006) (per curiam), and\r\nthe Court confirmed that the challenge could be main\r\ntained. Then, in WRTL, the controlling opinion of the\r\n\f16    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nCourt not only entertained an as-applied challenge but\r\nalso sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would\r\ncontinue to maintain the position that the record in\r\nMcConnell demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its\r\nface. 551 U. S., at 485\u2013504 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The\r\ncontrolling opinion in WRTL, which refrained from hold\r\ning the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then\r\nbefore the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the\r\nessential elements of the Court\u2019s opinion in McConnell,\r\nwhile vindicating the First Amendment arguments made\r\nby the WRTL parties. 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of\r\nROBERTS, C. J.).\r\n   As noted above, Citizens United\u2019s narrower arguments\r\nare not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In\r\nthe exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary\r\nthen for the Court to consider the facial validity of \u00a7441b.\r\nAny other course of decision would prolong the substan\r\ntial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by \u00a7441b\u2019s prohibi\r\ntions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the\r\nfacial validity of \u00a7441b is further supported by the follow\r\ning reasons.\r\n   First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position\r\nof the Government. As discussed above, see Part II\u2013D,\r\nsupra, the Government suggests, as an alternative argu\r\nment, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.\r\nThis argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit\r\ncorporation involved here may have received only de\r\nminimis donations from for-profit corporations and that\r\nsome nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the\r\noperation of the statute. The Government also suggests\r\nthat an as-applied challenge to \u00a7441b\u2019s ban on books may\r\nbe successful, although it would defend \u00a7441b\u2019s ban as\r\napplied to almost every other form of media including\r\npamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65\u201366 (Sept. 9, 2009).\r\nThe Government thus, by its own position, contributes to\r\nthe uncertainty that \u00a7441b causes. When the Government\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nholds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a\r\nnarrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position,\r\nthe added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to\r\naddress the question of statutory validity.\r\n   Second, substantial time would be required to bring\r\nclarity to the application of the statutory provision on\r\nthese points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by\r\nsome improper interpretation. See Part II\u2013C, supra. It is\r\nwell known that the public begins to concentrate on elec\r\ntions only in the weeks immediately before they are held.\r\nThere are short timeframes in which speech can have\r\ninfluence. The need or relevance of the speech will often\r\nfirst be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The deci\r\nsion to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns,\r\nwhen speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A\r\nspeaker\u2019s ability to engage in political speech that could\r\nhave a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker\r\nmust first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time\r\nthe lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the\r\nlitigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor,\r\nperhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could\r\nestablish that the case is not moot because the issue is\r\n\u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d WRTL, supra,\r\nat 462 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing Los Angeles v.\r\nLyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983); Southern Pacific Terminal\r\nCo. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911)). Here, Citizens\r\nUnited decided to litigate its case to the end. Today,\r\nCitizens United finally learns, two years after the fact,\r\nwhether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential\r\nprimary\u2014long after the opportunity to persuade primary\r\nvoters has passed.\r\n   Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the\r\nintegrity of the election process. As additional rules are\r\ncreated for regulating political speech, any speech argua\r\nbly within their reach is chilled. See Part II\u2013A, supra.\r\nCampaign finance regulations now impose \u201cunique and\r\n\f18    CITIZENS UNITED v.

Id., at 14\u201315, n. 10. The FEC\r\nhas adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of ex\r\nplanations and justifications for those regulations, and\r\n1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See id., at 6, n. 7. In\r\nfact, after this Court in WRTL adopted an objective \u201cap\r\npeal to vote\u201d test for determining whether a communica\r\ntion was the functional equivalent of express advocacy,\r\n551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC\r\nadopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement\r\nWRTL\u2019s ruling. See 11 CFR \u00a7114.15; Brief for Wyoming\r\nLiberty Group et al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201327 (filed Jan. 15,\r\n2009).\r\n   This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on\r\nspeech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective\r\nspeakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory\r\nopinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf.\r\nNear v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 712\u2013713\r\n(1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complex\r\nity of the regulations and the deference courts show to\r\nadministrative determinations, a speaker who wants to\r\navoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of\r\ndefending against FEC enforcement must ask a govern\r\nmental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2\r\nU. S. C. \u00a7437f; 11 CFR \u00a7112.1. These onerous restrictions\r\nthus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving\r\nthe FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented\r\nin 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmen\r\ntal practices of the sort that the First Amendment was\r\ndrawn to prohibit.

Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57\u201358 (1965). When the FEC\r\nissues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, \u201c[m]any\r\npersons, rather than undertake the considerable burden\r\n(and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through\r\ncase-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from\r\nprotected speech\u2014harming not only themselves but soci\r\nety as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited mar\r\nketplace of ideas.\u201d Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119\r\n(2003) (citation omitted). Consequently, \u201cthe censor\u2019s\r\ndetermination may in practice be final.\u201d Freedman, supra,\r\nat 58.\r\n   This is precisely what WRTL sought to avoid. WRTL\r\nsaid that First Amendment standards \u201cmust eschew \u2018the\r\nopen-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,\u2019 which \u2018invit[es]\r\ncomplex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevita\r\nble appeal.\u2019 \u201d 551 U.

S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original).\r\nYet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select\r\nwhat political speech is safe for public consumption by\r\napplying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litiga\r\ntion and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they\r\nmust either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue\r\nan advisory opinion approving of the political speech in\r\nquestion. Government officials pore over each word of a\r\ntext to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11\r\nfactor test they have promulgated. This is an unprece\r\ndented governmental intervention into the realm of\r\nspeech.\r\n   The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt\r\nprotected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the\r\nearlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can\r\nand must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has\r\nbeen demonstrated. See WRTL, supra, at 482\u2013483 (ALITO,\r\n\f20    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nJ., concurring); Thornhill v.

The following are\r\njust a few examples of restrictions that have been at\r\ntempted at different stages of the speech process\u2014all laws\r\nfound to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the\r\noutset, Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v.\r\nVillage of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 153 (2002); imposing a\r\nburden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties,\r\nSimon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime\r\nVictims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 108, 123 (1991); seeking to\r\nexact a cost after the speech occurs, New York Times Co. v.\r\nSullivan, 376 U.

S. 444,\r\n445 (1969) (per curiam).\r\n   The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal\r\nsanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corpora\r\ntions\u2014including nonprofit advocacy corporations\u2014either\r\nto expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates\r\nor to broadcast electioneering communications within 30\r\ndays of a primary election and 60 days of a general elec\r\ntion. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under\r\n\u00a7441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial\r\nphase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts\r\nthe public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors\r\nlogging in national forests; the National Rifle Association\r\npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the chal\r\nlenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a\r\nhandgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union\r\ncreates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presiden\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

These prohibitions are classic examples of\r\ncensorship.\r\n   Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstand\r\ning the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still\r\nspeak. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 330\u2013333 (opinion of\r\nKENNEDY, J.). A PAC is a separate association from the\r\ncorporation. So the PAC exemption from \u00a7441b\u2019s expendi\r\nture ban, \u00a7441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.\r\nEven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to\r\nspeak\u2014and it does not\u2014the option to form PACs does not\r\nalleviate the First Amendment problems with \u00a7441b.\r\nPACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to\r\nadminister and subject to extensive regulations. For\r\nexample, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward\r\ndonations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records\r\nof the identities of the persons making donations, preserve\r\nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement\r\nand report changes to this information within 10 days.\r\nSee id., at 330\u2013332 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 253\u2013\r\n254).\r\n   And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed\r\nmonthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different\r\ntimes depending on the type of election that is about to\r\noccur:\r\n    \u201c \u2018These reports must contain information regarding\r\n    the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of re\r\n    ceipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identifi\r\n    cation of each political committee and candidate\u2019s au\r\n    thorized or affiliated committee making contributions,\r\n    and any persons making loans, providing rebates, re\r\n    funds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to op\r\n    erating expenditures in an aggregate amount over\r\n    $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed\r\n    by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized\r\n\f22    CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 331\u2013332 (quoting MCFL, supra, at 253\u2013\r\n     254).\r\nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to\r\nspeak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the\r\nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs.\r\nSee Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as\r\nAmici Curiae 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity\r\n1990\u20132006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/\r\n20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income:\r\n2006, Corporation Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinaf\r\nter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations\r\nfiled 2006 tax returns). PACs, furthermore, must exist\r\nbefore they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a\r\ncorporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to\r\nmake its views known regarding candidates and issues in\r\na current campaign.\r\n   Section 441b\u2019s prohibition on corporate independent\r\nexpenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \u201crestriction on\r\nthe amount of money a person or group can spend on\r\npolitical communication during a campaign,\u201d that statute\r\n\u201cnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restrict\r\ning the number of issues discussed, the depth of their\r\nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.\u201d Buck\r\nley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 19 (1976) (per curiam). Were the\r\nCourt to uphold these restrictions, the Government could\r\nrepress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the\r\nvarious points in the speech process. See McConnell,\r\nsupra, at 251 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (Government could\r\nrepress speech by \u201cattacking all levels of the production\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

If \u00a7441b applied to individuals, no one would\r\nbelieve that it is merely a time, place, or manner restric\r\ntion on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence enti\r\nties whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.\r\n   Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is\r\nthe means to hold officials accountable to the people. See\r\nBuckley, supra, at 14\u201315 (\u201cIn a republic where the people\r\nare sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed\r\nchoices among candidates for office is essential\u201d). The\r\nright of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use\r\ninformation to reach consensus is a precondition to\r\nenlightened self-government and a necessary means to\r\nprotect it. The First Amendment \u201c \u2018has its fullest and most\r\nurgent application\u2019 to speech uttered during a campaign\r\nfor political office.\u201d Eu v. San Francisco County Democ\r\nratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting\r\nMonitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971)); see\r\nBuckley, supra, at 14 (\u201cDiscussion of public issues and\r\ndebate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to\r\nthe operation of the system of government established by\r\nour Constitution\u201d).\r\n   For these reasons, political speech must prevail against\r\nlaws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadver\r\ntence. Laws that burden political speech are \u201csubject to\r\nstrict scrutiny,\u201d which requires the Government to prove\r\nthat the restriction \u201cfurthers a compelling interest and is\r\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\u201d WRTL, 551\r\nU. S., at 464 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). While it might\r\nbe maintained that political speech simply cannot be\r\nbanned or restricted as a categorical matter, see Simon &\r\nSchuster, 502 U. S., at 124 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\r\njudgment), the quoted language from WRTL provides a\r\nsufficient framework for protecting the relevant First\r\nAmendment interests in this case. We shall employ it\r\n\f24    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n   Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First\r\nAmendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain\r\nsubjects or viewpoints. See, e.g., United States v. Playboy\r\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000)\r\n(striking down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too,\r\nare restrictions distinguishing among different speakers,\r\nallowing speech by some but not others. See First Nat.\r\nBank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 784 (1978). As\r\ninstruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:\r\nSpeech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker\r\nare all too often simply a means to control content.\r\n   Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating\r\ncontent, moreover, the Government may commit a consti\r\ntutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred\r\nspeakers. By taking the right to speak from some and\r\ngiving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvan\r\ntaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to\r\nestablish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker\u2019s\r\nvoice. The Government may not by these means deprive\r\nthe public of the right and privilege to determine for itself\r\nwhat speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.\r\nThe First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and\r\nthe ideas that flow from each.\r\n   The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restric\r\ntions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons,\r\nbut these rulings were based on an interest in allowing\r\ngovernmental entities to perform their functions. See, e.g.,\r\nBethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 683\r\n(1986) (protecting the \u201cfunction of public school educa\r\ntion\u201d); Jones v.

S. 733,\r\n759 (1974) (ensuring \u201cthe capacity of the Government to\r\ndischarge its [military] responsibilities\u201d (internal quota\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

S. 548, 557 (1973) (\u201c[F]ederal service should\r\ndepend upon meritorious performance rather than politi\r\ncal service\u201d). The corporate independent expenditures at\r\nissue in this case, however, would not interfere with gov\r\nernmental functions, so these cases are inapposite. These\r\nprecedents stand only for the proposition that there are\r\ncertain governmental functions that cannot operate with\r\nout some restrictions on particular kinds of speech. By\r\ncontrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political proc\r\ness that voters must be free to obtain information from\r\ndiverse sources in order to determine how to cast their\r\nvotes. At least before Austin, the Court had not allowed\r\nthe exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public\r\ndialogue.\r\n   We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context\r\nof political speech, the Government may impose restric\r\ntions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and\r\nlogic lead us to this conclusion.\r\n                              A\r\n                              1\r\n   The Court has recognized that First Amendment protec\r\ntion extends to corporations.

See, e.g., Button, 371 U. S.,\r\nat 428\u2013429; Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233,\r\n244 (1936). Under the rationale of these precedents,\r\npolitical speech does not lose First Amendment protection\r\n\u201csimply because its source is a corporation.\u201d Bellotti,\r\nsupra, at 784; see Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.\r\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 8 (1986) (plurality opinion)\r\n(\u201cThe identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining\r\nwhether speech is protected. Corporations and other\r\nassociations, like individuals, contribute to the \u2018discussion,\r\ndebate, and the dissemination of information and ideas\u2019\r\nthat the First Amendment seeks to foster\u201d (quoting Bel\r\nlotti, 435 U. S., at 783)). The Court has thus rejected the\r\nargument that political speech of corporations or other\r\nassociations should be treated differently under the First\r\nAmendment simply because such associations are not\r\n\u201cnatural persons.\u201d Id., at 776; see id., at 780, n. 16. Cf.\r\nid., at 828 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\r\n  At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the\r\nlaws of some States and of the United States imposed a\r\nban on corporate direct contributions to candidates.

See WRTL, 551\r\nU. S., at 502 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in\r\nthe background of United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106\r\n(1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional\r\ncandidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that\r\n\u201cthe gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the\r\nfederal expenditure prohibition\u2019s] constitutionality\u201d if it\r\nwere construed to suppress that writing. Id., at 121. The\r\nCourt engaged in statutory interpretation and found the\r\nstatute did not cover the publication. Id., at 121\u2013122, and\r\nn. 20. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the\r\nconstitutional question and invalidate the Labor Man\r\nagement Relations Act\u2019s expenditure ban. Id., at 155\r\n(Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ.,\r\nconcurring in result).

S. 385, 400\u2013\r\n401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expendi\r\nture of union funds for political speech\u2014again without\r\nreaching the constitutional question. The Court would not\r\nresolve that question for another four years.\r\n                             2\r\n  In Buckley, 424 U.

The Buckley Court recognized a \u201csufficiently impor\r\ntant\u201d governmental interest in \u201cthe prevention of corrup\r\ntion and the appearance of corruption.\u201d Id., at 25; see id.,\r\nat 26. This followed from the Court\u2019s concern that large\r\ncontributions could be given \u201cto secure a political quid pro\r\nquo.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid\r\npro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to\r\ncandidates from independent expenditures. The Court\r\nemphasized that \u201cthe independent expenditure ceiling . . .\r\nfails to serve any substantial governmental interest in\r\nstemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the\r\nelectoral process,\u201d id., at 47\u201348, because \u201c[t]he absence of\r\nprearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the dan\r\nger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for\r\nimproper commitments from the candidate,\u201d id., at 47.\r\nBuckley invalidated \u00a7608(e)\u2019s restrictions on independent\r\nexpenditures, with only one Justice dissenting. See Fed\r\neral Election Comm\u2019n v. National Conservative Political\r\nAction Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 491, n. 3 (1985) (NCPAC).\r\n   Buckley did not consider \u00a7610\u2019s separate ban on corpo\r\nrate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition\r\nthat had also been in the background in CIO, Automobile\r\nWorkers, and Pipefitters. Had \u00a7610 been challenged in the\r\nwake of Buckley, however, it could not have been squared\r\nwith the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See\r\nWRTL, supra, at 487 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\u201cBuckley\r\nmight well have been the last word on limitations on\r\nindependent expenditures\u201d); Austin, 494 U. S., at 683\r\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The expenditure ban invalidated\r\nin Buckley, \u00a7608(e), applied to corporations and unions,\r\n424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45; and some of the prevailing\r\nplaintiffs in Buckley were corporations, id., at 8. The\r\n\f30    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nBuckley Court did not invoke the First Amendment\u2019s\r\noverbreadth doctrine, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\r\nU. S. 601, 615 (1973), to suggest that \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure\r\nban would have been constitutional if it had applied only\r\nto corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., at 50.\r\nBuckley cited with approval the Automobile Workers dis\r\nsent, which argued that \u00a7610 was unconstitutional. 424\r\nU. S., at 43 (citing 352 U. S., at 595\u2013596 (opinion of Doug\r\nlas, J.)).\r\n   Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified\r\n\u00a7610\u2019s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7441b four months after Buckley was decided. See 90 Stat.\r\n490. Section 441b is the independent expenditure restric\r\ntion challenged here.\r\n   Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n765, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the\r\nGovernment cannot restrict political speech based on the\r\nspeaker\u2019s corporate identity. Bellotti could not have been\r\nclearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on\r\ncorporate independent expenditures related to referenda\r\nissues:\r\n        \u201cWe thus find no support in the First . . . Amend\r\n     ment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposi\r\n     tion that speech that otherwise would be within the\r\n     protection of the First Amendment loses that protec\r\n     tion simply because its source is a corporation that\r\n     cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material\r\n     effect on its business or property. . . . [That proposi\r\n     tion] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibi\r\n     tion of speech based on the identity of the interests\r\n     that spokesmen may represent in public debate over\r\n     controversial issues and a requirement that the\r\n     speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the sub\r\n     ject to justify communication.\r\n          .            .         .            .          .\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the realm of protected speech, the legislature is\r\n    constitutionally disqualified from dictating the sub\r\n    jects about which persons may speak and the speak\r\n    ers who may address a public issue.\u201d Id., at 784\u2013785.\r\nIt is important to note that the reasoning and holding of\r\nBellotti did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint\r\ndiscriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the\r\nGovernment lacks the power to ban corporations from\r\nspeaking.\r\n  Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the\r\nState\u2019s ban on corporate independent expenditures to\r\nsupport candidates. In our view, however, that restriction\r\nwould have been unconstitutional under Bellotti\u2019s central\r\nprinciple: that the First Amendment does not allow politi\r\ncal speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate\r\nidentity. See ibid.\r\n                               3\r\n   Thus the law stood until Austin. Austin \u201cuph[eld] a\r\ndirect restriction on the independent expenditure of funds\r\nfor political speech for the first time in [this Court\u2019s] his\r\ntory.\u201d 494 U. S., at 695 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). There,\r\nthe Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general\r\ntreasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a spe\r\ncific candidate. Michigan law, however, prohibited corpo\r\nrate independent expenditures that supported or opposed\r\nany candidate for state office. A violation of the law was\r\npunishable as a felony. The Court sustained the speech\r\nprohibition.\r\n   To bypass Buckley and Bellotti, the Austin Court identi\r\nfied a new governmental interest in limiting political\r\nspeech: an antidistortion interest. Austin found a compel\r\nling governmental interest in preventing \u201cthe corrosive\r\nand distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\r\nthat are accumulated with the help of the corporate form\r\nand that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s sup\r\n\f32      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nport for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d 494 U. S., at\r\n660; see id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257;\r\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500\u2013501).\r\n                               B\r\n   The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of\r\nprecedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on\r\npolitical speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity\r\nand a post-Austin line that permits them. No case before\r\nAustin had held that Congress could prohibit independent\r\nexpenditures for political speech based on the speaker\u2019s\r\ncorporate identity. Before Austin Congress had enacted\r\nlegislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the\r\nsame proposition before this Court. See MCFL, supra, at\r\n257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to \u201ccurb the\r\npolitical influence of \u2018those who exercise control over large\r\naggregations of capital\u2019 \u201d (quoting Automobile Workers,\r\nsupra, at 585)); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Elec\r\ntion Comm\u2019n, 453 U. S. 182, 201 (1981) (Congress believed\r\nthat \u201cdiffering structures and purposes\u201d of corporations\r\nand unions \u201cmay require different forms of regulation in\r\norder to protect the integrity of the electoral process\u201d). In\r\nneither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.\r\n   In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in\r\n\u00a7441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale\r\non which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but\r\nabandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two\r\nother compelling interests support Austin\u2019s holding that\r\ncorporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an\r\nanticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J.,\r\nconcurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see id.,\r\nat 674\u2013675 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the\r\nthree points in turn.\r\n                                 1\r\n     As for Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale, the Government\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           33\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ndoes little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45\u201348 (Sept.\r\n9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot\r\nsupport \u00a7441b.\r\n   If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Con\r\ngress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of\r\ncitizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the\r\nantidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it\r\nwould permit Government to ban political speech simply\r\nbecause the speaker is an association that has taken on\r\nthe corporate form. The Government contends that Austin\r\npermits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all\r\nforms of communication stemming from a corporation.\r\nSee Part II\u2013E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009);\r\nsee also id., at 26\u201331 (Mar. 24, 2009). If Austin were\r\ncorrect, the Government could prohibit a corporation from\r\nexpressing political views in media beyond those pre\r\nsented here, such as by printing books. The Government\r\nresponds \u201cthat the FEC has never applied this statute to a\r\nbook,\u201d and if it did, \u201cthere would be quite [a] good as\r\napplied challenge.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).\r\nThis troubling assertion of brooding governmental power\r\ncannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in\r\ncivic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.\r\n   Political speech is \u201cindispensable to decisionmaking in a\r\ndemocracy, and this is no less true because the speech\r\ncomes from a corporation rather than an individual.\u201d\r\nBellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see ibid. (the\r\nworth of speech \u201cdoes not depend upon the identity of its\r\nsource, whether corporation, association, union, or indi\r\nvidual\u201d); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48\u201349 (\u201c[T]he concept that\r\ngovernment may restrict the speech of some elements of\r\nour society in order to enhance the relative voice of others\r\nis wholly foreign to the First Amendment\u201d); Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); CIO,\r\n335 U. S., at 154\u2013155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).\r\nThis protection for speech is inconsistent with Austin\u2019s\r\n\f34    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nantidistortion rationale. Austin sought to defend the\r\nantidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corpora\r\ntions from obtaining \u201c \u2018an unfair advantage in the political\r\nmarketplace\u2019 \u201d by using \u201c \u2018resources amassed in the eco\r\nnomic marketplace.\u2019 \u201d 494 U. S., at 659 (quoting MCFL,\r\nsupra, at 257). But Buckley rejected the premise that the\r\nGovernment has an interest \u201cin equalizing the relative\r\nability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome\r\nof elections.\u201d 424 U. S., at 48; see Bellotti, supra, at 791,\r\nn. 30. Buckley was specific in stating that \u201cthe skyrocket\r\ning cost of political campaigns\u201d could not sustain the\r\ngovernmental prohibition. 424 U. S., at 26. The First\r\nAmendment\u2019s protections do not depend on the speaker\u2019s\r\n\u201cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\u201d Id., at\r\n49.\r\n   The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invali\r\ndated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on con\r\ntributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain\r\nexpenditures from personal funds. See Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16)\r\n(\u201cLeveling electoral opportunities means making and\r\nimplementing judgments about which strengths should be\r\npermitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The\r\nConstitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress,\r\nthe power to choose the Members of the House of Repre\r\nsentatives, Art. I, \u00a72, and it is a dangerous business for\r\nCongress to use the election laws to influence the voters\u2019\r\nchoices\u201d). The rule that political speech cannot be limited\r\nbased on a speaker\u2019s wealth is a necessary consequence of\r\nthe premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits\r\nthe suppression of political speech based on the speaker\u2019s\r\nidentity.\r\n   Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a\r\nfurther argument, the Austin majority undertook to dis\r\ntinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the\r\nground that \u201c[s]tate law grants corporations special ad\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 658\u2013659. This does not suffice,\r\nhowever, to allow laws prohibiting speech. \u201cIt is rudimen\r\ntary that the State cannot exact as the price of those\r\nspecial advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment\r\nrights.\u201d Id., at 680 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\n   It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment\r\nthat corporate funds may \u201chave little or no correlation to\r\nthe public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d\r\nId., at 660 (majority opinion). All speakers, including\r\nindividuals and the media, use money amassed from the\r\neconomic marketplace to fund their speech. The First\r\nAmendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was\r\nenabled by economic transactions with persons or entities\r\nwho disagree with the speaker\u2019s ideas. See id., at 707\r\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cMany persons can trace their\r\nfunds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then\r\nin the form of dividends, interest, or salary\u201d).\r\n   Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale would produce the\r\ndangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress\r\ncould ban political speech of media corporations. See\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (\u201cThe\r\nchilling endpoint of the Court\u2019s reasoning is not difficult to\r\nforesee: outright regulation of the press\u201d). Cf. Tornillo,\r\n418 U. S., at 250 (alleging the existence of \u201cvast accumula\r\ntions of unreviewable power in the modern media em\r\npires\u201d). Media corporations are now exempt from \u00a7441b\u2019s\r\nban on corporate expenditures.              See 2 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i).    Yet media corporations\r\naccumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the\r\nlargest media corporations have \u201cimmense aggregations of\r\nwealth,\u201d and the views expressed by media corporations\r\noften \u201chave little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support\u201d\r\nfor those views. Austin, 494 U. S., at 660. Thus, under\r\nthe Government\u2019s reasoning, wealthy media corporations\r\n\f36    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncould have their voices diminished to put them on par\r\nwith other media entities. There is no precedent for per\r\nmitting this under the First Amendment.\r\n  The media exemption discloses further difficulties with\r\nthe law now under consideration. There is no precedent\r\nsupporting laws that attempt to distinguish between\r\ncorporations which are deemed to be exempt as media\r\ncorporations and those which are not. \u201cWe have consis\r\ntently rejected the proposition that the institutional press\r\nhas any constitutional privilege beyond that of other\r\nspeakers.\u201d Id., at 691 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing Bel\r\nlotti, 435 U. S., at 782); see Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.\r\nGreenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 784 (1985) (Bren\r\nnan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and STEVENS, JJ.,\r\ndissenting); id., at 773 (White, J., concurring in judgment).\r\nWith the advent of the Internet and the decline of print\r\nand broadcast media, moreover, the line between the\r\nmedia and others who wish to comment on political and\r\nsocial issues becomes far more blurred.\r\n  The law\u2019s exception for media corporations is, on its own\r\nterms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidis\r\ntortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further,\r\nseparate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its\r\nown terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers\r\nothers, even though both have the need or the motive to\r\ncommunicate their views. The exemption applies to media\r\ncorporations owned or controlled by corporations that have\r\ndiverse and substantial investments and participate in\r\nendeavors other than news. So even assuming the most\r\ndoubtful proposition that a news organization has a right\r\nto speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a\r\nconglomerate that owns both a media business and an\r\nunrelated business to influence or control the media in\r\norder to advance its overall business interest. At the same\r\ntime, some other corporation, with an identical business\r\ninterest but no media outlet in its ownership structure,\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          37\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwould be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the\r\nsame issue. This differential treatment cannot be squared\r\nwith the First Amendment.\r\n  There is simply no support for the view that the First\r\nAmendment, as originally understood, would permit the\r\nsuppression of political speech by media corporations. The\r\nFramers may not have anticipated modern business and\r\nmedia corporations.      See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\r\nComm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334, 360\u2013361 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,\r\nconcurring in judgment). Yet television networks and\r\nmajor newspapers owned by media corporations have\r\nbecome the most important means of mass communication\r\nin modern times. The First Amendment was certainly not\r\nunderstood to condone the suppression of political speech\r\nin society\u2019s most salient media. It was understood as a\r\nresponse to the repression of speech and the press that\r\nhad existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press\r\nthat were imposed in the colonies. See McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 252\u2013253 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); Grosjean, 297\r\nU. S., at 245\u2013248; Near, 283 U. S., at 713\u2013714. The great\r\ndebates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists\r\nover our founding document were published and expressed\r\nin the most important means of mass communication of\r\nthat era\u2014newspapers owned by individuals. See McIn\r\ntyre, 514 U. S., at 341\u2013343; id., at 367 (THOMAS, J., con\r\ncurring in judgment). At the founding, speech was open,\r\ncomprehensive, and vital to society\u2019s definition of itself;\r\nthere were no limits on the sources of speech and knowl\r\nedge. See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American\r\nRevolution 5 (1967) (\u201cAny number of people could join in\r\nsuch proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from\r\nall sides\u201d); G.

It permits the Government to ban\r\nthe political speech of millions of associations of citizens.\r\nSee Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corpora\r\ntions filed 2006 tax returns). Most of these are small\r\ncorporations without large amounts of wealth. See Supp.\r\nBrief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of\r\nAmerica as Amicus Curiae 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million busi\r\nnesses that belong to the U. S.

S. C.\r\n\u00a7301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year).

This\r\nmakes Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale all the more an\r\naberration. \u201c[T]he First Amendment protects the right of\r\ncorporations to petition legislative and administrative\r\nbodies.\u201d Bellotti, 435 U.

Rhetoric\r\nought not obscure reality.\r\n   Even if \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban were constitutional,\r\nwealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials,\r\nalthough smaller corporations may not have the resources\r\nto do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated\r\nassociations can spend unlimited amounts on independent\r\nexpenditures. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S., at 503\u2013504\r\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (\u201cIn the 2004 election cycle, a mere\r\n24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142\r\nmillion to [26 U. S. C. \u00a7527 organizations]\u201d). Yet certain\r\ndisfavored associations of citizens\u2014those that have taken\r\non the corporate form\u2014are penalized for engaging in the\r\nsame political speech.\r\n   When Government seeks to use its full power, including\r\nthe criminal law, to command where a person may get his\r\nor her information or what distrusted source he or she\r\nmay not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This\r\nis unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom\r\nto think for ourselves.\r\n                             2\r\n  What we have said also shows the invalidity of other\r\narguments made by the Government. For the most part\r\nrelinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government\r\nfalls back on the argument that corporate political speech\r\ncan be banned in order to prevent corruption or its ap\r\npearance. In Buckley, the Court found this interest \u201csuffi\r\nciently important\u201d to allow limits on contributions but did\r\nnot extend that reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U. S.,\r\nat 25. When Buckley examined an expenditure ban, it\r\nfound \u201cthat the governmental interest in preventing cor\r\nruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inade\r\nquate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\u201d\r\nId., at 45.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

The Court, in\r\nconsequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contri\r\nbutions are preventative, because few if any contributions\r\nto candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.\r\nMCFL, 479 U.

The Buckley Court,\r\nnevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in\r\norder to ensure against the reality or appearance of cor\r\nruption. That case did not extend this rationale to inde\r\npendent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.\r\n   \u201cThe absence of prearrangement and coordination of an\r\nexpenditure with the candidate or his agent not only\r\nundermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,\r\nbut also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be\r\ngiven as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from\r\nthe candidate.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (inde\r\npendent expenditures have a \u201csubstantially diminished\r\npotential for abuse\u201d). Limits on independent expendi\r\ntures, such as \u00a7441b, have a chilling effect extending well\r\nbeyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing quid pro\r\nquo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not suffi\r\ncient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26\r\nStates do not restrict independent expenditures by for\r\nprofit corporations. The Government does not claim that\r\nthese expenditures have corrupted the political process in\r\nthose States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp.\r\nBrief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of\r\n\f42    CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 788, n. 26. For\r\nthe reasons explained above, we now conclude that inde\r\npendent expenditures, including those made by corpora\r\ntions, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of\r\ncorruption. Dicta in Bellotti\u2019s footnote suggested that \u201ca\r\ncorporation\u2019s right to speak on issues of general public\r\ninterest implies no comparable right in the quite different\r\ncontext of participation in a political campaign for election\r\nto public office.\u201d Ibid. Citing the portion of Buckley that\r\ninvalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424\r\nU. S., at 46, and a law review student comment, Bellotti\r\nsurmised that \u201cCongress might well be able to demon\r\nstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corrup\r\ntion in independent expenditures by corporations to influ\r\nence candidate elections.\u201d 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.\r\nBuckley, however, struck down a ban on independent\r\nexpenditures to support candidates that covered corpora\r\ntions, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that \u201cthe\r\ndistinction between discussion of issues and candidates\r\nand advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often\r\ndissolve in practical application,\u201d id., at 42. Bellotti\u2019s\r\ndictum is thus supported only by a law review student\r\ncomment, which misinterpreted Buckley.

NRWC,\r\nhowever, has little relevance here. NRWC decided no\r\nmore than that a restriction on a corporation\u2019s ability to\r\nsolicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct\r\ncontributions to candidates, did not violate the First\r\nAmendment. 459 U.

NRWC thus involved\r\ncontribution limits, see NCPAC, supra, at 495\u2013496, which,\r\nunlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an\r\naccepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption, see\r\nMcConnell, 540 U.

Citizens United has not made direct\r\ncontributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that\r\nthe Court should reconsider whether contribution limits\r\nshould be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.\r\n   When Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov\r\nernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap\r\npearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\r\npro quo corruption.

By\r\ndefinition, an independent expenditure is political speech\r\npresented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a\r\ncandidate. See Buckley, supra, at 46. The fact that a\r\ncorporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend\r\nmoney to try to persuade voters presupposes that the\r\npeople have the ultimate influence over elected officials.\r\nThis is inconsistent with any suggestion that the elector\r\nate will refuse \u201c \u2018to take part in democratic governance\u2019 \u201d\r\nbecause of additional political speech made by a corpora\r\ntion or any other speaker.

Supp. 2d, at 209, yet it \u201cdoes not have\r\nany direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . ex\r\npenditures,\u201d id., at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.). This\r\nconfirms Buckley\u2019s reasoning that independent expendi\r\ntures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro\r\nquo corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that\r\nindependent expenditures even ingratiate.            See 251\r\nF. Supp. 2d, at 555\u2013557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).\r\nIngratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.\r\nThe BCRA record establishes that certain donations to\r\npolitical parties, called \u201csoft money,\u201d were made to gain\r\naccess to elected officials. McConnell, supra, at 125, 130\u2013\r\n131, 146\u2013152; see McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 471\u2013\r\n481, 491\u2013506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 842\u2013\r\n843, 858\u2013859 (opinion of Leon, J.). This case, however, is\r\nabout independent expenditures, not soft money. When\r\nCongress finds that a problem exists, we must give that\r\nfinding due deference; but Congress may not choose an\r\nunconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to\r\nimproper influences from independent expenditures; if\r\nthey surrender their best judgment; and if they put expe\r\ndiency before principle, then surely there is cause for\r\nconcern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to\r\nseek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these\r\ninfluences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must\r\ncomply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and\r\nour tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing\r\nrule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during\r\nthe critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.\r\nHere Congress has created categorical bans on speech that\r\nare asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption.\r\n\f46      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N \r\n\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\n                               3\r\n\r\n   The Government contends further that corporate inde\r\npendent expenditures can be limited because of its interest\r\nin protecting dissenting shareholders from being com\r\npelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted\r\ninterest, like Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale, would allow\r\nthe Government to ban the political speech even of media\r\ncorporations. See supra, at 35\u201337. Assume, for example,\r\nthat a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper\r\ndisagrees with the political views the newspaper ex\r\npresses. See Austin, 494 U. S., at 687 (SCALIA, J., dissent\r\ning). Under the Government\u2019s view, that potential dis\r\nagreement could give the Government the authority to\r\nrestrict the media corporation\u2019s political speech. The First\r\nAmendment does not allow that power. There is, further\r\nmore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by\r\nshareholders \u201cthrough the procedures of corporate democ\r\nracy.\u201d Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 794; see id., at 794, n. 34.\r\n   Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder\r\nprotection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both\r\nunderinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Con\r\ngress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders,\r\nit would not have banned corporate speech in only certain\r\nmedia within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissent\r\ning shareholder\u2019s interests would be implicated by speech\r\nin any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is\r\noverinclusive because it covers all corporations, including\r\nnonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with\r\nonly single shareholders. As to other corporations, the\r\nremedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and ex\r\nplore other regulatory mechanisms.             The regulatory\r\nmechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First\r\nAmendment.\r\n                            4\r\n     We need not reach the question whether the Govern\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

Cf. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441e (contribution and\r\nexpenditure ban applied to \u201cforeign national[s]\u201d). Section\r\n441b is not limited to corporations or associations that\r\nwere created in foreign countries or funded predominately\r\nby foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be\r\noverbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Gov\r\nernment has a compelling interest in limiting foreign\r\ninfluence over our political process.

When neither\r\nparty defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of\r\nadhering to that precedent through stare decisis is dimin\r\nished. Austin abandoned First Amendment principles,\r\nfurthermore, by relying on language in some of our prece\r\ndents that traces back to the Automobile Workers Court\u2019s\r\nflawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see\r\nBrief for Campaign Finance Scholars as Amici Curiae;\r\nHayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns,\r\nCongress, and Courts 33\u201335, 153\u2013157 (1988). See Austin,\r\nsupra, at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257\u2013258;\r\nNCPAC, 470 U.

Our\r\nNation\u2019s speech dynamic is changing, and informative\r\nvoices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions\r\nto exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have\r\nbecome adept at presenting citizens with sound bites,\r\ntalking points, and scripted messages that dominate the\r\n24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not\r\nhave monolithic views. On certain topics corporations\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           49\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmay possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best\r\nequipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of\r\nall sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected\r\nofficials.\r\n   Rapid changes in technology\u2014and the creative dynamic\r\ninherent in the concept of free expression\u2014counsel against\r\nupholding a law that restricts political speech in certain\r\nmedia or by certain speakers. See Part II\u2013C, supra.\r\nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective\r\nway to convey a political message. See McConnell, supra,\r\nat 261 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Soon, however, it may be\r\nthat Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking\r\nWeb sites, will provide citizens with significant informa\r\ntion about political candidates and issues. Yet, \u00a7441b\r\nwould seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the\r\nelection or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created\r\nwith corporate funds. See 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b(a); MCFL,\r\nsupra, at 249. The First Amendment does not permit\r\nCongress to make these categorical distinctions based on\r\nthe corporate identity of the speaker and the content of\r\nthe political speech.\r\n   No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court\r\nstated in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991),\r\nreliance interests are important considerations in property\r\nand contract cases, where parties may have acted in con\r\nformance with existing legal rules in order to conduct\r\ntransactions. Here, though, parties have been prevented\r\nfrom acting\u2014corporations have been banned from making\r\nindependent expenditures. Legislatures may have en\r\nacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those\r\nbans were constitutional. This is not a compelling interest\r\nfor stare decisis. If it were, legislative acts could prevent\r\nus from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfer\r\ning with our duty \u201cto say what the law is.\u201d Marbury v.\r\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).\r\n   Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin, 494\r\n\f50    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nU. S. 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to\r\nthe principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the\r\nGovernment may not suppress political speech on the\r\nbasis of the speaker\u2019s corporate identity. No sufficient\r\ngovernmental interest justifies limits on the political\r\nspeech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.\r\n                              D\r\n   Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing\r\nthe Government to limit corporate independent expendi\r\ntures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling\r\nAustin \u201ceffectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section\r\n203, but also 2 U. S. C. 441b\u2019s prohibition on the use of\r\ncorporate treasury funds for express advocacy.\u201d Brief for\r\nAppellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate\r\nindependent expenditures are therefore invalid and can\r\nnot be applied to Hillary.\r\n   Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule\r\nthe part of McConnell that upheld BCRA \u00a7203\u2019s extension\r\nof \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate independent expendi\r\ntures. See 540 U. S., at 203\u2013209. The McConnell Court\r\nrelied on the antidistortion interest recognized in Austin\r\nto uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restric\r\ntion upheld in Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have\r\nfound this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This\r\npart of McConnell is now overruled.\r\n                             IV \r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n    Citizens United next challenges BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and\r\ndisclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three\r\nadvertisements for the movie. Under BCRA \u00a7311, tele\r\nvised electioneering communications funded by anyone\r\nother than a candidate must include a disclaimer that\r\n\u201c \u2018_______ is responsible for the content of this advertis\r\ning.\u2019 \u201d 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441d(d)(2). The required statement\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          51\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmust be made in a \u201cclearly spoken manner,\u201d and displayed\r\non the screen in a \u201cclearly readable manner\u201d for at least\r\nfour seconds. Ibid. It must state that the communication\r\n\u201cis not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s commit\r\ntee\u201d; it must also display the name and address (or Web\r\nsite address) of the person or group that funded the adver\r\ntisement. \u00a7441d(a)(3). Under BCRA \u00a7201, any person\r\nwho spends more than $10,000 on electioneering commu\r\nnications within a calendar year must file a disclosure\r\nstatement with the FEC. 2 U. S. C. \u00a7434(f)(1). That\r\nstatement must identify the person making the expendi\r\nture, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which\r\nthe communication was directed, and the names of certain\r\ncontributors. \u00a7434(f)(2).\r\n   Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the\r\nability to speak, but they \u201cimpose no ceiling on campaign\r\nrelated activities,\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, and \u201cdo not\r\nprevent anyone from speaking,\u201d McConnell, supra, at 201\r\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The\r\nCourt has subjected these requirements to \u201cexacting scru\r\ntiny,\u201d which requires a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between the\r\ndisclosure requirement and a \u201csufficiently important\u201d\r\ngovernmental interest. Buckley, supra, at 64, 66 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see McConnell, supra, at 231\u2013\r\n232.\r\n   In Buckley, the Court explained that disclosure could be\r\njustified based on a governmental interest in \u201cprovid[ing]\r\nthe electorate with information\u201d about the sources of\r\nelection-related spending. 424 U. S., at 66. The McCon\r\nnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial chal\r\nlenges to BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. There\r\nwas evidence in the record that independent groups were\r\nrunning election-related advertisements \u201c \u2018while hiding\r\nbehind dubious and misleading names.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 197 (quot\r\ning McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237). The Court\r\ntherefore upheld BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 on the ground that\r\n\f52    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthey would help citizens \u201c \u2018make informed choices in the\r\npolitical marketplace.\u2019 \u201d 540 U. S., at 197 (quoting McCon\r\nnell I, supra, at 237); see 540 U. S., at 231.\r\n  Although both provisions were facially upheld, the\r\nCourt acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be\r\navailable if a group could show a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d\r\nthat disclosure of its contributors\u2019 names \u201c \u2018will subject\r\nthem to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either\r\nGovernment officials or private parties.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 198\r\n(quoting Buckley, supra, at 74).\r\n  For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid\r\nas applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.\r\n                            B\r\n   Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and\r\ntwo 10-second ads to promote Hillary. Under FEC regula\r\ntions, a communication that \u201c[p]roposes a commercial\r\ntransaction\u201d was not subject to 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b\u2019s restric\r\ntions on corporate or union funding of electioneering com\r\nmunications. 11 CFR \u00a7114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations,\r\nhowever, do not exempt those communications from the\r\ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201\r\nand 311. See 72 Fed. Reg. 72901 (2007).\r\n   Citizens United argues that the disclaimer require\r\nments in \u00a7311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads.\r\nIt contends that the governmental interest in providing\r\ninformation to the electorate does not justify requiring\r\ndisclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including\r\nthe ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within\r\nBCRA\u2019s definition of an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d:\r\nThey referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly\r\nbefore a primary and contained pejorative references to\r\nher candidacy. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2\u20134. The\r\ndisclaimers required by \u00a7311 \u201cprovid[e] the electorate with\r\ninformation,\u201d McConnell, supra, at 196, and \u201cinsure that\r\nthe voters are fully informed\u201d about the person or group\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          53\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwho is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76; see also Bellotti,\r\n435 U. S., at 792, n. 32 (\u201cIdentification of the source of\r\nadvertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so\r\nthat the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to\r\nwhich they are being subjected\u201d). At the very least, the\r\ndisclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads\r\nare not funded by a candidate or political party.\r\n   Citizens United argues that \u00a7311 is underinclusive\r\nbecause it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertise\r\nments but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts\r\nthat \u00a7311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of\r\nthe group\u2019s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of\r\neach advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected\r\nthese arguments in McConnell, supra, at 230\u2013231. And\r\nwe now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclo\r\nsure provisions.\r\n   As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any\r\nevent, the disclosure requirements in \u00a7201 must be con\r\nfined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express\r\nadvocacy. The principal opinion in WRTL limited 2\r\nU. S. C. \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on independent expenditures\r\nto express advocacy and its functional equivalent. 551\r\nU. S., at 469\u2013476 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Citizens\r\nUnited seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA\u2019s\r\ndisclosure requirements. We reject this contention.\r\n   The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restric\r\ntive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of\r\nspeech. See, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 262. In Buckley, the\r\nCourt upheld a disclosure requirement for independent\r\nexpenditures even though it invalidated a provision that\r\nimposed a ceiling on those expenditures. 424 U. S., at 75\u2013\r\n76. In McConnell, three Justices who would have found\r\n\u00a7441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold\r\nBCRA\u2019s disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540\r\nU. S., at 321 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist,\r\nC. J., and SCALIA, J.). And the Court has upheld registra\r\n\f54    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntion and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even\r\nthough Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself.\r\nUnited States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612, 625 (1954) (Con\r\ngress \u201chas merely provided for a modicum of information\r\nfrom those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or\r\nwho collect or spend funds for that purpose\u201d). For these\r\nreasons, we reject Citizens United\u2019s contention that the\r\ndisclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is\r\nthe functional equivalent of express advocacy.\r\n   Citizens United also disputes that an informational\r\ninterest justifies the application of \u00a7201 to its ads, which\r\nonly attempt to persuade viewers to see the film. Even if\r\nit disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens\r\nUnited says, the information would not help viewers make\r\ninformed choices in the political marketplace. This is\r\nsimilar to the argument rejected above with respect to\r\ndisclaimers. Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial\r\ntransaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is\r\nspeaking about a candidate shortly before an election.\r\nBecause the informational interest alone is sufficient to\r\njustify application of \u00a7201 to these ads, it is not necessary\r\nto consider the Government\u2019s other asserted interests.\r\n   Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure require\r\nments can chill donations to an organization by exposing\r\ndonors to retaliation. Some amici point to recent events in\r\nwhich donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threat\r\nened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for\r\nInstitute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 13\u201316; Brief for\r\nAlliance Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 16\u201322. In\r\nMcConnell, the Court recognized that \u00a7201 would be un\r\nconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a\r\nreasonable probability that the group\u2019s members would\r\nface threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were\r\ndisclosed. 540 U. S., at 198. The examples cited by amici\r\nare cause for concern. Citizens United, however, has\r\noffered no evidence that its members may face similar\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          55\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthreats or reprisals. To the contrary, Citizens United has\r\nbeen disclosing its donors for years and has identified no\r\ninstance of harassment or retaliation.\r\n   Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of\r\ncorporate democracy, see Bellotti, supra, at 794, and n. 34,\r\ncan be more effective today because modern technology\r\nmakes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign\r\nfinance system that pairs corporate independent expendi\r\ntures with effective disclosure has not existed before to\r\nday. It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Con\r\ngress\u2019 findings in passing BCRA were premised on a\r\nsystem without adequate disclosure. See McConnell, 540\r\nU. S., at 128 (\u201c[T]he public may not have been fully in\r\nformed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads\u201d); id.,\r\nat 196\u2013197 (quoting McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237).\r\nWith the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of\r\nexpenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with\r\nthe information needed to hold corporations and elected\r\nofficials accountable for their positions and supporters.\r\nShareholders can determine whether their corporation\u2019s\r\npolitical speech advances the corporation\u2019s interest in\r\nmaking profits, and citizens can see whether elected offi\r\ncials are \u201c \u2018in the pocket\u2019 of so-called moneyed interests.\u201d\r\n540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see MCFL, supra,\r\nat 261. The First Amendment protects political speech;\r\nand disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react\r\nto the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This\r\ntransparency enables the electorate to make informed\r\ndecisions and give proper weight to different speakers and\r\nmessages.\r\n                           C\r\n   For the same reasons we uphold the application of\r\nBCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their applica\r\ntion to Hillary. We find no constitutional impediment to\r\nthe application of BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure re\r\n\f56    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nquirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand.\r\nAnd there has been no showing that, as applied in this\r\ncase, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or\r\nexpression.\r\n                              V\r\n   When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith\r\nGoes to Washington reached the circles of Government,\r\nsome officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its\r\ndistribution. See Smoodin, \u201cCompulsory\u201d Viewing for\r\nEvery Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception,\r\n35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing\r\nMr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49);\r\nNugent, Capra\u2019s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29,\r\n1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have\r\ndone more than discourage its distribution\u2014they could\r\nhave banned the film. After all, it, like Hillary, was\r\nspeech funded by a corporation that was critical of Mem\r\nbers of Congress. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be\r\nfiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a\r\npowerful force.\r\n   Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on\r\nYoutube.com might portray public officials or public poli\r\ncies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission\r\nduring the blackout period creates the background for\r\ncandidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs\r\nsolely because a corporation, other than an exempt media\r\ncorporation, has made the \u201cpurchase, payment, distribu\r\ntion, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of\r\nvalue\u201d in order to engage in political speech. 2 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm\r\nwhere its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue\r\npreceding a real election. Governments are often hostile\r\nto speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems\r\nstranger than fiction for our Government to make this\r\npolitical speech a crime. Yet this is the statute\u2019s purpose\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

Those choices and assessments, however,\r\nare not for the Government to make. \u201cThe First Amend\r\nment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create\r\nin the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free\r\nto use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of\r\nideas.

It asks us to embrace a\r\ntheory of the First Amendment that would allow censor\r\nship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of\r\npamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other\r\nmedium that corporations and unions might find useful in\r\nexpressing their views on matters of public concern. Its\r\ntheory, if accepted, would empower the Government to\r\nprohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion\r\npieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long\r\nas the newspapers were owned by corporations\u2014as the\r\nmajor ones are. First Amendment rights could be confined\r\nto individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse\r\nthat is at the foundation of our democracy.\r\n   The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its\r\nopinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than\r\njust the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphle\r\nteer. I write separately to address the important princi\r\nples of judicial restraint and stare decisis implicated in\r\nthis case.\r\n                           I\r\n  Judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is\r\n\f2     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Holden, 275 U. S. 142,\r\n147\u2013148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring). Because the\r\nstakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from\r\naddressing constitutional questions except when necessary\r\nto rule on particular claims before us. See Ashwander v.\r\nTVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346\u2013348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concur\r\nring). This policy underlies both our willingness to con\r\nstrue ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems\r\nand our practice \u201c \u2018never to formulate a rule of constitu\r\ntional law broader than is required by the precise facts to\r\nwhich it is to be applied.\u2019 \u201d United States v.

If there\r\nwere a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in\r\nCitizens United\u2019s favor (and thereby avoiding constitu\r\ntional adjudication), it would be proper to do so. Indeed,\r\nthat is precisely the approach the Court took just last\r\nTerm in Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v.\r\nHolder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), when eight Members of the\r\nCourt agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds\r\ninstead of reaching the appellant\u2019s broader argument that\r\nthe Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\n   It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United\u2019s\r\nstatutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group\u2019s\r\nvarious constitutional arguments, beginning with its\r\nnarrowest claim (that Hillary is not the functional equiva\r\nlent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest\r\nclaim (that Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494\r\nU. S. 652 (1990) should be overruled). This is the same\r\norder of operations followed by the controlling opinion in\r\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,\r\n551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL). There the appellant was\r\nable to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument\r\nbecause its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to\r\ngo on to address the broader claim that McConnell v.\r\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93 (2003), should be\r\noverruled. WRTL, 551 U. S., at 482; id., at 482\u2013483\r\n(ALITO, J., concurring). This case is different\u2014not, as the\r\ndissent suggests, because the approach taken in WRTL\r\nhas been deemed a \u201cfailure,\u201d post, at 11, but because, in\r\nthe absence of any valid narrower ground of decision,\r\nthere is no way to avoid Citizens United\u2019s broader consti\r\ntutional argument.\r\n   The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citi\r\nzens United\u2019s claims that I find quite perplexing. It pre\r\nsumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United\u2019s\r\nnarrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack\r\nmerit\u2014otherwise its conclusion that the group should lose\r\nthis case would make no sense. Despite agreeing that\r\nthese narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent ar\r\ngues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one\r\nof them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitu\r\ntional question of whether Austin remains good law. It\r\neven suggests that the Court\u2019s failure to adopt one of these\r\nconcededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority\r\nis not \u201cserious about judicial restraint.\u201d Post, at 16.\r\n   This approach is based on a false premise: that our\r\n\f4     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\npractice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily\r\nbroad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obli\r\ngation faithfully to interpret the law. It should go without\r\nsaying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground\r\nof decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be\r\nright. Thus while it is true that \u201c[i]f it is not necessary to\r\ndecide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\u201d post, at 14\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it is neces\r\nsary to decide more. There is a difference between judicial\r\nrestraint and judicial abdication. When constitutional\r\nquestions are \u201cindispensably necessary\u201d to resolving the\r\ncase at hand, \u201cthe court must meet and decide them.\u201d Ex\r\nparte Randolph, 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va.\r\n1833) (Marshall, C. J.).\r\n   Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United\u2019s\r\nbroader argument that Austin should be overruled, the\r\ndebate over whether to consider this claim on an as\r\napplied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the\r\npoint. Citizens United has standing\u2014it is being injured\r\nby the Government\u2019s enforcement of the Act. Citizens\r\nUnited has a constitutional claim\u2014the Act violates the\r\nFirst Amendment, because it prohibits political speech.\r\nThe Government has a defense\u2014the Act may be enforced,\r\nconsistent with the First Amendment, against corpora\r\ntions. Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the\r\nquestion before us.\r\n   Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no\r\ndifference of any substance whether this case is resolved\r\nby invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to\r\nCitizens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a\r\nholding in this case that the Act may not be applied to\r\nCitizens United\u2014because corporations as well as indi\r\nviduals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights\u2014\r\nwould mean that any other corporation raising the same\r\nchallenge would also win. Likewise, a conclusion that the\r\nAct may be applied to Citizens United\u2014because it is\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Regardless whether\r\nwe label Citizens United\u2019s claim a \u201cfacial\u201d or \u201cas-applied\u201d\r\nchallenge, the consequences of the Court\u2019s decision are the\r\nsame.1\r\n                             II\r\n  The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in\r\nthe same direction: Congress may not prohibit political\r\nspeech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union.\r\nWhat makes this case difficult is the need to confront our\r\nprior decision in Austin.\r\n  This is the first case in which we have been asked to\r\noverrule Austin, and thus it is also the first in which we\r\nhave had reason to consider how much weight to give stare\r\ndecisis in assessing its continued validity. The dissent\r\nerroneously declares that the Court \u201creaffirmed\u201d Austin\u2019s\r\nholding in subsequent cases\u2014namely, Federal Election\r\nComm\u2019n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003); McConnell;\r\nand WRTL. Post, at 48\u201350. Not so. Not a single party in\r\nany of those cases asked us to overrule Austin, and as the\r\ndissent points out, post, at 4\u20136, the Court generally does\r\nnot consider constitutional arguments that have not prop\r\nerly been raised. Austin\u2019s validity was therefore not di\r\nrectly at issue in the cases the dissent cites. The Court\u2019s\r\nunwillingness to overturn Austin in those cases cannot be\r\nunderstood as a reaffirmation of that decision.\r\n                            A\r\n  Fidelity to precedent\u2014the policy of stare decisis\u2014is vital\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 The dissent suggests that I am \u201cmuch too quick\u201d to reach this con\r\n\r\nclusion because I \u201cignore\u201d Citizens United\u2019s narrower arguments. Post,\r\nat 13, n. 12. But in fact I do not ignore those arguments; on the con\r\ntrary, I (and my colleagues in the majority) appropriately consider and\r\nreject them on their merits, before addressing Citizens United\u2019s broader\r\nclaims.

As the\r\ndissent properly notes, none of us has viewed stare decisis\r\nin such absolute terms. Post, at 17; see also, e.g., Randall\r\nv. Sorrell, 548 U.

When considering whether to reexamine a\r\nprior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance\r\nof having constitutional questions decided against the\r\nimportance of having them decided right. As Justice\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nJackson explained, this requires a \u201csober appraisal of the\r\ndisadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the\r\nquestioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one\r\nagainst the other.\u201d Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare\r\nDecisis, 30 A. B. A. J. 334 (1944).\r\n   In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that\r\nstare decisis is not an end in itself. It is instead \u201cthe\r\nmeans by which we ensure that the law will not merely\r\nchange erratically, but will develop in a principled and\r\nintelligible fashion.\u201d Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265\r\n(1986). Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional\r\nideal\u2014the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual\r\ncircumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent\r\ndoes more to damage this constitutional ideal than to\r\nadvance it, we must be more willing to depart from that\r\nprecedent.\r\n   Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration\r\nitself departed from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, returning\r\nto the \u201c \u2018intrinsically sounder\u2019 doctrine established in prior\r\ncases\u201d may \u201cbetter serv[e] the values of stare decisis than\r\nwould following [the] more recently decided case inconsis\r\ntent with the decisions that came before it.\u201d Adarand\r\nConstructors, Inc. v.

Abrogating the errant prece\r\ndent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better\r\npreserve the law\u2019s coherence and curtail the precedent\u2019s\r\ndisruptive effects.\r\n   Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes\r\nthe stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its\r\nstare decisis effect is also diminished. This can happen in\r\na number of circumstances, such as when the precedent\u2019s\r\nvalidity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably func\r\ntion as a basis for decision in future cases, when its ra\r\ntionale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in\r\nrelated areas of law, and when the precedent\u2019s underlying\r\n\f8     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nreasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot\r\nkeep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and\r\ndifferent justifications to shore up the original mistake.\r\nSee, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\r\n(slip op., at 10); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___\r\n(2009) (slip op., at 13) (stare decisis does not control when\r\nadherence to the prior decision requires \u201cfundamentally\r\nrevising its theoretical basis\u201d).\r\n                              B\r\n  These considerations weigh against retaining our deci\r\nsion in Austin. First, as the majority explains, that deci\r\nsion was an \u201caberration\u201d insofar as it departed from the\r\nrobust protections we had granted political speech in our\r\nearlier cases. Ante, at 39; see also Buckley, supra; First\r\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978).\r\nAustin undermined the careful line that Buckley drew to\r\ndistinguish limits on contributions to candidates from\r\nlimits on independent expenditures on speech. Buckley\r\nrejected the asserted government interest in regulating\r\nindependent expenditures, concluding that \u201crestrict[ing]\r\nthe speech of some elements of our society in order to\r\nenhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the\r\nFirst Amendment.\u201d 424 U. S., at 48\u201349; see also Bellotti,\r\nsupra, at 790\u2013791; Citizens Against Rent Con\u00ad\r\ntrol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,\r\n295 (1981). Austin, however, allowed the Government to\r\nprohibit these same expenditures out of concern for \u201cthe\r\ncorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of\r\nwealth\u201d in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U. S., at 660.\r\nAustin\u2019s reasoning was\u2014and remains\u2014inconsistent with\r\nBuckley\u2019s explicit repudiation of any government interest\r\nin \u201cequalizing the relative ability of individuals and\r\ngroups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d 424 U. S., at\r\n48\u201349.\r\n  Austin was also inconsistent with Bellotti\u2019s clear rejec\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\r\n\r\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\ntion of the idea that \u201cspeech that otherwise would be\r\nwithin the protection of the First Amendment loses that\r\nprotection simply because its source is a corporation.\u201d 435\r\nU. S., at 784. The dissent correctly points out that Bellotti\r\ninvolved a referendum rather than a candidate election,\r\nand that Bellotti itself noted this factual distinction, id., at\r\n788, n. 26; post, at 52. But this distinction does not ex\r\nplain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on\r\nspeech in candidate elections when individuals may not.\r\n   Second, the validity of Austin\u2019s rationale\u2014itself adopted\r\nover two \u201cspirited dissents,\u201d Payne, 501 U. S., at 829\u2014has\r\nproved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Mem\r\nbers of this Court ever since. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 483 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.,\r\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment); McCon\u00ad\r\nnell, 540 U. S., at 247, 264, 286 (opinions of SCALIA,\r\nTHOMAS, and KENNEDY, JJ.); Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163,\r\n164 (opinions of KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.). The simple\r\nfact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of\r\ncourse, insufficient to justify overruling it. But it does\r\nundermine the precedent\u2019s ability to contribute to the\r\nstable and orderly development of the law. In such cir\r\ncumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Court\u2014\r\nwhich in this case is squarely asked to reconsider Austin\u2019s\r\nvalidity for the first time\u2014to address the matter with a\r\ngreater willingness to consider new approaches capable of\r\nrestoring our doctrine to sounder footing.\r\n   Third, the Austin decision is uniquely destabilizing\r\nbecause it threatens to subvert our Court\u2019s decisions even\r\noutside the particular context of corporate express advo\r\ncacy. The First Amendment theory underlying Austin\u2019s\r\nholding is extraordinarily broad. Austin\u2019s logic would\r\nauthorize government prohibition of political speech by a\r\ncategory of speakers in the name of equality\u2014a point that\r\nmost scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that\r\nthe dissent denies. Compare, e.g., Garrett, New Voices in\r\n\f10        CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                      ROBERTS, C.

See, e.g., Davis v. Federal\r\nElection Comm\u2019n, 554 U.

The dissent reads Austin to permit restrictions on\r\ncorporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that\r\nthe corporate form may help individuals coordinate and\r\npresent their views more effectively. Post, at 82. A\r\nspeaker\u2019s ability to persuade, however, provides no basis\r\nfor government regulation of free and open public debate\r\non what the laws should be.\r\n   If taken seriously, Austin\u2019s logic would apply most di\r\nrectly to newspapers and other media corporations. They\r\nhave a more profound impact on public discourse than\r\nmost other speakers. These corporate entities are, for the\r\ntime being, not subject to \u00a7441b\u2019s otherwise generally\r\napplicable prohibitions on corporate political speech. But\r\nthis is simply a matter of legislative grace. The fact that\r\nthe law currently grants a favored position to media cor\r\nporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in\r\naccepting a theory that would allow government restric\r\ntions on their political speech. See generally McConnell,\r\nsupra, at 283\u2013286 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concur\r\nring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).\r\n   These readings of Austin do no more than carry that\r\ndecision\u2019s reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so,\r\nthey highlight the threat Austin poses to First Amend\r\nment rights generally, even outside its specific factual\r\ncontext of corporate express advocacy. Because Austin is\r\nso difficult to confine to its facts\u2014and because its logic\r\nthreatens to undermine our First Amendment jurispru\r\ndence and the nature of public discourse more broadly\u2014\r\nthe costs of giving it stare decisis effect are unusually high.\r\n   Finally and most importantly, the Government\u2019s own\r\neffort to defend Austin\u2014or, more accurately, to defend\r\nsomething that is not quite Austin\u2014underscores its weak\r\nness as a precedent of the Court.

But while invoking stare decisis to support this\r\nposition, the Government never once even mentions the\r\ncompelling interest that Austin relied upon in the first\r\nplace: the need to diminish \u201cthe corrosive and distorting\r\neffects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accu\r\nmulated with the help of the corporate form and that have\r\nlittle or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corpo\r\nration\u2019s political ideas.\u201d 494 U.

Those interests\r\nmay or may not support the result in Austin, but they were\r\nplainly not part of the reasoning on which Austin relied.\r\n   To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that\r\nAustin did not embrace either of the new rationales it now\r\nurges upon us. See, e.g., Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (\u201cThe\r\nCourt did not decide in Austin . . . whether the compelling\r\ninterest in preventing actual or apparent corruption pro\r\nvides a constitutionally sufficient justification for prohibit\r\ning the use of corporate treasury funds for independent\r\nelectioneering\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (\u201cAus\u00ad\r\ntin did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest\r\ncompelling interest\u201d); id., at 61 (\u201c[The Court:] I take it we\r\nhave never accepted your shareholder protection interest.\r\nThis is a new argument.

In fact, the only opinion in Austin endorsing\r\nthe Government\u2019s argument based on the threat of quid\r\npro quo corruption was JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019s concurrence.\r\n494 U. S., at 678. The Court itself did not do so, despite\r\nthe fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument.\r\nMoreover, the Court\u2019s only discussion of shareholder pro\r\ntection in Austin appeared in a section of the opinion that\r\nsought merely to distinguish Austin\u2019s facts from those of\r\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n v. Massachusetts Citizens for\r\nLife, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986). Austin, supra, at 663.\r\nNowhere did Austin suggest that the goal of protecting\r\nshareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing\r\nrestrictions on First Amendment rights.\r\n   To the extent that the Government\u2019s case for reaffirming\r\nAustin depends on radically reconceptualizing its reason\r\ning, that argument is at odds with itself. Stare decisis is a\r\ndoctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels\r\ndeference to past mistakes, but provides no justification\r\nfor making new ones. There is therefore no basis for the\r\nCourt to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has\r\nnever accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to\r\nsupport a conclusion reached on different grounds that\r\nhave since been abandoned or discredited.\r\n   Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that\r\njustify stare decisis in the first place. It would effectively\r\nlicense the Court to invent and adopt new principles of\r\nconstitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing\r\nits past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those\r\nprinciples have merit on their own. This approach would\r\nallow the Court\u2019s past missteps to spawn future mistakes,\r\nundercutting the very rule-of-law values that stare decisis\r\nis designed to protect.\r\n   None of this is to say that the Government is barred\r\nfrom making new arguments to support the outcome in\r\nAustin. On the contrary, it is free to do so. And of course\r\nthe Court is free to accept them. But the Government\u2019s\r\n\f14    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\r\n\r\nnew arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are\r\nnot entitled to receive the special deference we accord to\r\nprecedent. They are, as grounds to support Austin, liter\r\nally unprecedented. Moreover, to the extent the Govern\r\nment relies on new arguments\u2014and declines to defend\r\nAustin on its own terms\u2014we may reasonably infer that it\r\nlacks confidence in that decision\u2019s original justification.\r\n  Because continued adherence to Austin threatens to\r\nsubvert the \u201cprincipled and intelligible\u201d development of\r\nour First Amendment jurisprudence, Vasquez, 474 U.

This section of the dissent\r\npurports to show that today\u2019s decision is not supported by\r\nthe original understanding of the First Amendment. The\r\ndissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid\r\nisolation from the text of the First Amendment. It never\r\nshows why \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d that was the right of\r\nEnglishmen did not include the freedom to speak in asso\r\nciation with other individuals, including association in the\r\ncorporate form. To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations\r\ncould pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters;\r\nbut the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in\r\nthe pursuit of those objectives could be censored.\r\n  Instead of taking this straightforward approach to\r\ndetermining the Amendment\u2019s meaning, the dissent em\r\nbarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers\u2019 views\r\nabout the \u201crole of corporations in society.\u201d Post, at 35.\r\nThe Framers didn\u2019t like corporations, the dissent con\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n 1 JUSTICE   THOMAS does not join Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion.\r\n\f2      CITIZENS UNITED v.

Of course the\r\nFramers\u2019 personal affection or disaffection for corporations\r\nis relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected\r\nin the understood meaning of the text they enacted\u2014not,\r\nas the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for\r\nthat text. But the dissent\u2019s distortion of proper analysis is\r\neven worse than that. Though faced with a constitutional\r\ntext that makes no distinction between types of speakers,\r\nthe dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated\r\nstatement from the founding era to the effect that corpora\r\ntions are not covered, but places the burden on petitioners\r\nto bring forward statements showing that they are (\u201cthere\r\nis not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that\r\nanyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude\r\nregulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,\u201d post,\r\nat 34\u201335).\r\n   Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent\r\nhas dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the\r\n18th century corporations were despised. If so, how came\r\nthere to be so many of them? The dissent\u2019s statement that\r\nthere were few business corporations during the eight\r\neenth century\u2014\u201conly a few hundred during all of the 18th\r\ncentury\u201d\u2014is misleading. Post, at 35, n. 53. There were\r\napproximately 335 charters issued to business corpora\r\ntions in the United States by the end of the 18th century.2\r\nSee 2 J.

I used\r\n1800 only because the dissent did. But in any case, it is surely fanciful\r\nto think that a consensus of hostility towards corporations was trans\r\nformed into general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and\r\n1796.\r\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

Moreover, what seems\r\nlike a small number by today\u2019s standards surely does not\r\nindicate the relative importance of corporations when the\r\nNation was considerably smaller. As I have previously\r\nnoted, \u201c[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corpora\r\ntion was a familiar figure in American economic life.\u201d\r\nMcConnell v.

Cooke,\r\nCorporation Trust and Company 92 (1951) (hereinafter\r\nCooke)).\r\n   Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent\u2019s ap\r\nproach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what\r\nthe Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the\r\nFounders disliked founding-era corporations; modern\r\ncorporations might not qualify for exclusion. Most of the\r\nFounders\u2019 resentment towards corporations was directed\r\nat the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually\r\nchartered corporations enjoyed.3 Modern corporations do\r\nnot have such privileges, and would probably have been\r\nfavored by most of our enterprising Founders\u2014excluding,\r\nperhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetua\r\ntion of an agrarian society. Moreover, if the Founders\u2019\r\nspecific intent with respect to corporations is what mat\r\nters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders\u2019 views\r\nabout other legal entities that have more in common with\r\nmodern business corporations than the founding-era cor\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 \u201c[P]eople in 1800 identified corporations with franchised monopo\r\nlies.\u201d L.

At the time of the founding, religious, educa\r\ntional, and literary corporations were incorporated under\r\ngeneral incorporation statutes, much as business corpora\r\ntions are today.4 See Davis 16\u201317; R. Seavoy, Origins of\r\nthe American Business Corporation, 1784\u20131855, p. 5\r\n(1982); Cooke 94. There were also small unincorporated\r\nbusiness associations, which some have argued were the\r\n\u201c \u2018true progenitors\u2019 \u201d of today\u2019s business corporations.\r\nFriedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American\r\nLand Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Develop\r\nment 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33. Were all of these\r\nsilently excluded from the protections of the First\r\nAmendment?\r\n    The lack of a textual exception for speech by corpora\r\ntions cannot be explained on the ground that such organi\r\nzations did not exist or did not speak. To the contrary,\r\ncolleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds\r\nhad long been organized as corporations at common law\r\nand under the King\u2019s charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Com\r\nmentaries on the Laws of England 455\u2013473 (1765); 1 S.\r\nKyd, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations 1\u201332, 63\r\n(1793) (reprinted 2006), and as I have discussed, the prac\r\ntice of incorporation only expanded in the United States.\r\nBoth corporations and voluntary associations actively\r\npetitioned the Government and expressed their views in\r\nnewspapers and pamphlets. For example: An antislavery\r\nQuaker corporation petitioned the First Congress, distrib\r\nuted pamphlets, and communicated through the press in\r\n1790.

See post,\r\nat 37. Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the\r\nrights of business corporations and the rights of non-business corpora\r\ntions is even more imaginative than finding a distinction between the\r\nrights of all corporations and the rights of other associations.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Post, at 40,\r\nn. 56. For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White\u2019s statement\r\n(in dissent) that \u201c[t]he common law was generally interpreted as\r\nprohibiting corporate political participation,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston\r\nv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978). The sole authority Justice White\r\ncited for this proposition, id., at 819, n. 14, was a law-review note that\r\nmade no such claim. To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing\r\nwith the propriety of corporate political expenditures were \u201cfew.\u201d Note,\r\nCorporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L. J. 821, 852 (1961).\r\nMore specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by\r\na Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana.\r\nId., at 852, n. 197. Of course even if the common law was \u201cgenerally\r\ninterpreted\u201d to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires,\r\nthat would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that\r\nwere authorized by a corporation\u2019s charter could constitutionally be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n   As additional \u201c[p]ostratification practice,\u201d the dissent notes that the\r\nCourt \u201cdid not recognize any First Amendment protections for corpora\r\ntions until the middle part of the 20th century.\u201d Post, at 40, n. 56. But\r\nit did that in Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936), a\r\ncase involving freedom of the press\u2014which the dissent acknowledges\r\ndid cover corporations from the outset. The relative recency of that\r\nfirst case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence\r\nwas slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First\r\nAmendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until\r\n1919, see Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919); we did not\r\ninvalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see\r\n\f6      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\n   Historical evidence relating to the textually similar\r\nclause \u201cthe freedom of . . . the press\u201d also provides no\r\nsupport for the proposition that the First Amendment\r\nexcludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope\r\nof its protection. The freedom of \u201cthe press\u201d was widely\r\nunderstood to protect the publishing activities of individ\r\nual editors and printers. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\r\nComm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334, 360 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concur\r\nring in judgment); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 252\u2013\r\n253 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But these individuals often\r\nacted through newspapers, which (much like corporations)\r\nhad their own names, outlived the individuals who had\r\nfounded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes\r\nowned by more than one person, and were operated for\r\nprofit. See generally F. Mott, American Journalism: A\r\nHistory of Newspapers in the United States Through 250\r\nYears 3\u2013164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom\u2019s Fetters (1956).\r\nTheir activities were not stripped of First Amendment\r\nprotection simply because they were carried out under the\r\nbanner of an artificial legal entity. And the notion which\r\nfollows from the dissent\u2019s view, that modern newspapers,\r\nsince they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only\r\nat the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.6\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nStromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931), and a federal law until\r\n1965, see Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965).\r\n   6 The dissent seeks to avoid this conclusion (and to turn a liability\r\n\r\ninto an asset) by interpreting the Freedom of the Press Clause to refer\r\nto the institutional press (thus demonstrating, according to the dissent,\r\nthat the Founders \u201cdid draw distinctions\u2014explicit distinctions\u2014\r\nbetween types of \u2018speakers,\u2019 or speech outlets or forms \u201d). Post, at 40\r\nand n. 57. It is passing strange to interpret the phrase \u201cthe freedom of\r\nspeech, or of the press\u201d to mean, not everyone\u2019s right to speak or pub\r\nlish, but rather everyone\u2019s right to speak or the institutional press\u2019s\r\nright to publish. No one thought that is what it meant. Patriot Noah\r\nWebster\u2019s 1828 dictionary contains, under the word \u201cpress,\u201d the follow\r\ning entry:\r\n   \u201cLiberty of the press, in civil policy, is the free right of publishing\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

The Framers\r\n\u201cwould have been appalled,\u201d it says, by the evidence of\r\ncorruption in the congressional findings supporting the\r\nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. Post, at 61.\r\nFor this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article\r\narguing that \u201ccorruption\u201d was originally understood to\r\ninclude \u201cmoral decay\u201d and even actions taken by citizens\r\nin pursuit of private rather than public ends. Teachout,\r\nThe Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L. Rev. 341,\r\n373, 378 (2009). It is hard to see how this has anything to\r\ndo with what sort of corruption can be combated by re\r\nstrictions on political speech. Moreover, if speech can be\r\nprohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads\r\nto \u201cmoral decay\u201d or does not serve \u201cpublic ends,\u201d then\r\nthere is no limit to the Government\u2019s censorship power.\r\n  The dissent says that when the Framers \u201cconstitutional\r\nized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it\r\nwas the free speech of individual Americans that they had\r\nin mind.\u201d Post, at 37. That is no doubt true. All the\r\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of indi\r\nvidual men and women\u2014not, for example, of trees or polar\r\nbears. But the individual person\u2019s right to speak includes\r\nthe right to speak in association with other individual\r\npersons. Surely the dissent does not believe that speech\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nbooks, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unre\r\nstrained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and\r\nopinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious\r\nto morals or to the peace of the state.\u201d 2 American Dictionary of the\r\nEnglish Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).\r\n   As the Court\u2019s opinion describes, ante, at 36, our jurisprudence\r\nagrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.\r\n   \u201cThe liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodi\r\ncals.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\r\n\r\nby the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be\r\ncensored because it is not the speech of \u201can individual\r\nAmerican.\u201d It is the speech of many individual Americans,\r\nwho have associated in a common cause, giving the leader\r\nship of the party the right to speak on their behalf. The\r\nassociation of individuals in a business corporation is no\r\ndifferent\u2014or at least it cannot be denied the right to speak\r\non the simplistic ground that it is not \u201can individual\r\nAmerican.\u201d7\r\n  But to return to, and summarize, my principal point,\r\nwhich is the conformity of today\u2019s opinion with the original\r\nmeaning of the First Amendment. The Amendment is\r\nwritten in terms of \u201cspeech,\u201d not speakers. Its text offers\r\nno foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    7 Thedissent says that \u201c \u2018speech\u2019 \u201d refers to oral communications of\r\nhuman beings, and since corporations are not human beings they\r\ncannot speak. Post, at 37, n. 55. This is sophistry. The authorized\r\nspokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of\r\nthe human beings who have formed that association\u2014just as the\r\nspokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its\r\nmembers. The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to\r\nspeak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no\r\nproblem with a corporation\u2019s enjoying the freedom of the press.\r\n   The same footnote asserts that \u201cit has been \u2018claimed that the notion\r\nof institutional speech . . . did not exist in post-revolutionary America.\u2019 \u201d\r\nThis is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment\r\nSpeakers, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the\r\nsole support for its statement a treatise dealing with government\r\nspeech, M. Yudof, When Government Speaks 42\u201350 (1983). The cited\r\npages of that treatise provide no support whatever for the statement\u2014\r\nunless, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the \u201cinstitutional speech\u201d\r\nreferred to was speech by the subject of the law-review article, govern\r\nmental institutions.\r\n   The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a\r\nprofessor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional\r\nSpeech, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent,\r\nin that it would accord free-speech protection to associations.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

We are therefore simply left with the\r\nquestion whether the speech at issue in this case is\r\n\u201cspeech\u201d covered by the First Amendment. No one says\r\notherwise. A documentary film critical of a potential\r\nPresidential candidate is core political speech, and its\r\nnature as such does not change simply because it was\r\nfunded by a corporation. Nor does the character of that\r\nfunding produce any reduction whatever in the \u201cinherent\r\nworth of the speech\u201d and \u201cits capacity for informing the\r\npublic,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.\r\n765, 777 (1978). Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate\r\nspeech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free\r\neconomy.

Citizens United\r\nis a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political\r\naction committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets.\r\nUnder the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002\r\n(BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and\r\npromote Hillary: The Movie wherever and whenever it\r\nwanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to\r\nbroadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days\r\nbefore the last primary election. Neither Citizens United\u2019s\r\nnor any other corporation\u2019s speech has been \u201cbanned,\u201d\r\nante, at 1. All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens\r\nUnited had a right to use the funds in its general treasury\r\nto pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period. The notion\r\nthat the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer\r\nto that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided.\r\nEven more misguided is the notion that the Court must\r\nrewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by for\r\nprofit corporations and unions to decide this case.\r\n   The basic premise underlying the Court\u2019s ruling is its\r\niteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that\r\nthe First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based\r\n\f2     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\non a speaker\u2019s identity, including its \u201cidentity\u201d as a corpo\u00ad\r\nration. While that glittering generality has rhetorical\r\nappeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it\r\ntell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering\r\nthat some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even\r\nresolve the specific question whether Citizens United may\r\nbe required to finance some of its messages with the\r\nmoney in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be\r\ntreated identically to natural persons in the political\r\nsphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify\r\nthe Court\u2019s disposition of this case.\r\n   In the context of election to public office, the distinction\r\nbetween corporate and human speakers is significant.\r\nAlthough they make enormous contributions to our soci\u00ad\r\nety, corporations are not actually members of it. They\r\ncannot vote or run for office. Because they may be man\u00ad\r\naged and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may\r\nconflict in fundamental respects with the interests of\r\neligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure,\r\nand instrumental orientation of corporations raise legiti\u00ad\r\nmate concerns about their role in the electoral process.\r\nOur lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if\r\nnot also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to\r\nguard against the potentially deleterious effects of corpo\u00ad\r\nrate spending in local and national races.\r\n   The majority\u2019s approach to corporate electioneering\r\nmarks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has\r\nplaced special limitations on campaign spending by corpo\u00ad\r\nrations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907,\r\nch. 420, 34 Stat. 864.

Michi\r\ngan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990).

Because departures from those rules always en\u00ad\r\nhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of\r\nthis case in some detail before explaining why the Court\u2019s\r\nanalysis rests on a faulty understanding of Austin and\r\nMcConnell and of our campaign finance jurisprudence\r\nmore generally .1 I regret the length of what follows, but\r\nthe importance and novelty of the Court\u2019s opinion require\r\na full response.

Part III,\r\ninfra, at 23\u201356, addresses the Court\u2019s assumptions that BCRA \u201cbans\u201d\r\ncorporate speech, that identity-based distinctions may not be drawn in\r\nthe political realm, and that Austin and McConnell were outliers in our\r\nFirst Amendment tradition. Part IV, infra, at 56\u201389, addresses the\r\nCourt\u2019s treatment of the anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder\r\nprotection rationales for regulating corporate electioneering.\r\n\f4           CITIZENS UNITED v.

The path it has\r\ntaken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this\r\ninstitution. Before turning to the question whether to\r\noverrule Austin and part of McConnell, it is important\r\nto explain why the Court should not be deciding that\r\nquestion.\r\nScope of the Case\r\n  The first reason is that the question was not properly\r\nbrought before us. In declaring \u00a7203 of BCRA facially\r\nunconstitutional on the ground that corporations\u2019 electoral\r\nexpenditures may not be regulated any more stringently\r\nthan those of individuals, the majority decides this case on\r\na basis relinquished below, not included in the questions\r\npresented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in\r\nresponse to the Court\u2019s invitation. This procedure is\r\nunusual and inadvisable for a court.2 Our colleagues\u2019\r\nsuggestion that \u201cwe are asked to reconsider Austin and, in\r\neffect, McConnell,\u201d ante, at 1, would be more accurate if\r\nrephrased to state that \u201cwe have asked ourselves\u201d to re\u00ad\r\nconsider those cases.\r\n  In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a\r\nfacial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7203.

The District Court therefore resolved the\r\ncase on alternative grounds,3 and in its jurisdictional\r\nstatement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised\r\nus that it was raising only \u201can as-applied challenge to the\r\nconstitutionality of . . .

And not\r\none of the questions presented suggested that Citizens\r\nUnited was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to\r\n\u00a7203 that it previously agreed to dismiss. In fact, not one\r\nof those questions raised an issue based on Citizens\r\nUnited\u2019s corporate status. Juris. Statement (i). Moreover,\r\neven in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected\r\nits request to overrule Austin, it never sought a declara\u00ad\r\ntion that \u00a7203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corpo\u00ad\r\nrations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute\r\ncould not be applied to it because it was \u201cfunded over\u00ad\r\nwhelmingly by individuals.\u201d Brief for Appellant 29; see\r\nalso id., at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming \u201cas applied\u201d character\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 The majority states that, in denying Citizens United\u2019s motion for a\r\npreliminary injunction, the District Court \u201caddressed\u201d the facial valid\u00ad\r\nity of BCRA \u00a7203.

That latter ruling by the District Court was the \u201cfinal\r\ndecision\u201d from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under\r\nBCRA \u00a7403(a)(3). As regards the lower court decision that has come\r\nbefore us, the claim that \u00a7203 is facially unconstitutional was neither\r\npressed nor passed upon in any form.\r\n\f6     CITIZENS UNITED v.

The appellant in this case did not so much as\r\nassert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the\r\nmajority opinion in vain for the mention of any.

The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry\r\n\u201crun[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial\r\nrestraint that courts should neither anticipate a question\r\nof constitutional law in advance of the necessity of decid\u00ad\r\ning it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader\r\nthan is required by the precise facts to which it is to be\r\napplied.\u201d Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 450\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Scanting that princi\u00ad\r\nple \u201cthreaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by\r\npreventing laws embodying the will of the people from\r\nbeing implemented in a manner consistent with the Con\u00ad\r\nstitution.\u201d Id., at 451. These concerns are heightened\r\nwhen judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the\r\nlegislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge\r\nhammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of\r\nCongress\u2019 most significant efforts to regulate the role that\r\ncorporations and unions play in electoral politics. It com\u00ad\r\npounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great\r\nmany state laws as well.\r\n   The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of\r\nthis on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United\r\nmaintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there\r\nare virtually no circumstances in which BCRA \u00a7203 can be\r\napplied constitutionally, the parties could have developed,\r\nthrough the normal process of litigation, a record about\r\nthe actual effects of \u00a7203, its actual burdens and its actual\r\nbenefits, on all manner of corporations and unions.4\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  4 Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its\r\nfacial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it\r\n\u201crequire[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial\r\nchallenge.\u201d 1:07\u2013cv\u20132240\u2013RCL\u2013RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar.\r\n26, 2008). By reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the\r\nCourt gives it a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which\r\nwas deprived of the opportunity to gather and present information\r\nnecessary to its rebuttal.\r\n\f8      CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n\u201cClaims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,\u201d and\r\nconsequently \u201craise the risk of premature interpretation of\r\nstatutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\u201d Id.,\r\nat 450 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case,\r\nthe record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is\r\nnonexistent. Congress crafted BCRA in response to a\r\nvirtual mountain of research on the corruption that previ\u00ad\r\nous legislation had failed to avert. The Court now negates\r\nCongress\u2019 efforts without a shred of evidence on how \u00a7203\r\nor its state-law counterparts have been affecting any\r\nentity other than Citizens United.5\r\n   Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority\r\nthrows up its hands. Were we to confine our inquiry to\r\nCitizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge, it protests, we\r\nwould commence an \u201cextended\u201d process of \u201cdraw[ing], and\r\nthen redraw[ing], constitutional lines based on the par\u00ad\r\nticular media or technology used to disseminate political\r\nspeech from a particular speaker.\u201d Ante, at 9. While\r\ntacitly acknowledging that some applications of \u00a7203\r\nmight be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a\r\nfuture in which novel First Amendment standards must\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   5 In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how \u00a7203\r\n\r\nhas been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the\r\nDistrict Court the details of Hillary\u2019s funding or its own finances. We\r\nlikewise have no evidence of how \u00a7203 and comparable state laws were\r\nexpected to affect corporations and unions in the future.\r\n   It is true, as the majority points out, that the McConnell Court\r\nevaluated the facial validity of \u00a7203 in light of an extensive record. See\r\nante, at 15. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any\r\nevent, the majority\u2019s argument for striking down \u00a7203 depends on its\r\ncontention that the statute has proved too \u201cchilling\u201d in practice\u2014and in\r\nparticular on the contention that the controlling opinion in WRTL, 551\r\nU. S. 449 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and \u201cbreathing space\u201d\r\nto this area of law. See ante, at 12, 16\u201320. We have no record with\r\nwhich to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the\r\nburdens of complying with \u00a7203, but we have no meaningful evidence to\r\nshow how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory sys\u00ad\r\ntems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies,\r\nmay raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins.\r\nThe fluid nature of electioneering communications does\r\nnot make this case special. The fact that a Court can\r\nhypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some\r\npoint down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied\r\nproblems, does not come close to meeting the standard for\r\na facial challenge.6\r\n  The majority proposes several other justifications for the\r\nsweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is\r\nnecessary because, if the Court were to continue on its\r\nnormal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they\r\npresent themselves, that process would itself run afoul of\r\nthe First Amendment. See, e.g., ante, at 9 (as-applied\r\nreview process \u201cwould raise questions as to the courts\u2019 own\r\nlawful authority\u201d); ibid. (\u201cCourts, too, are bound by the\r\nFirst Amendment\u201d). This suggestion is perplexing. Our\r\ncolleagues elsewhere trumpet \u201cour duty \u2018to say what the\r\nlaw is,\u2019 \u201d even when our predecessors on the bench and our\r\ncounterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differ\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   6 Our cases recognize a \u201ctype of facial challenge in the First Amend\u00ad\r\n\r\nment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly\r\noverbroad because a substantial number of its applications are uncon\u00ad\r\nstitutional.\u201d Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\r\nParty, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\r\nted). Citizens United has not made an overbreadth argument, and\r\n\u201c[w]e generally do not apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analy\u00ad\r\nsis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable over\u00ad\r\nbreadth of the contested law,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nIf our colleagues nonetheless concluded that \u00a7203\u2019s fatal flaw is that it\r\naffects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for\r\noverbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissi\u00ad\r\nble, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.\r\n\f10     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nently. Ante, at 49 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\r\n137, 177 (1803)). We do not typically say what the law is\r\nnot as a hedge against future judicial error. The possibil\u00ad\r\nity that later courts will misapply a constitutional provi\u00ad\r\nsion does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation\r\nrelating to that provision.7\r\n    The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary\r\nbecause anything less would chill too much protected\r\nspeech. See ante, at 9\u201310, 12, 16\u201320. In addition to beg\u00ad\r\nging the question what types of corporate spending are\r\nconstitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim\r\nrests on the assertion that some significant number of\r\ncorporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC\r\n\u201c \u2018censor[ship].\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 18\u201319. That assertion is unsub\u00ad\r\nstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experi\u00ad\r\nence. It is particularly hard to square with the legal land\u00ad\r\nscape following WRTL, which held that a corporate\r\ncommunication could be regulated under \u00a7203 only if it\r\nwas \u201csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other\r\nthan as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi\u00ad\r\ndate.\u201d 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (em\u00ad\r\nphasis added). The whole point of this test was to make\r\n\u00a7203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The\r\nCourt does not explain how, in the span of a single election\r\ncycle, it has determined THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s project to be\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   7 Also perplexing is the majority\u2019s attempt to pass blame to the Gov\u00ad\r\n\r\nernment for its litigating position. By \u201chold[ing] out the possibility of\r\nruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from\r\nadopting that position,\u201d the majority says, the Government has caused\r\n\u201cadded uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the\r\nquestion of statutory validity.\u201d Ante, at 17. Our colleagues have\r\napparently never heard of an alternative argument. Like every liti\u00ad\r\ngant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that,\r\nit would prefer to lose on a narrow ground. The fact that there are\r\nnumerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the\r\nGovernment acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything\r\nabout the propriety of a facial ruling.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

In this respect, too, the majority\u2019s critique of\r\nline-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied\r\nreview method generally.8\r\n   The majority suggests that, even though it expressly\r\ndismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United neverthe\u00ad\r\nless preserved it\u2014not as a freestanding \u201cclaim,\u201d but as a\r\npotential argument in support of \u201ca claim that the FEC\r\nhas violated its First Amendment right to free speech.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 13; see also ante, at 4 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring)\r\n(describing Citizens United\u2019s claim as: \u201c[T]he Act violates\r\nthe First Amendment\u201d). By this novel logic, virtually any\r\nsubmission could be reconceptualized as \u201ca claim that the\r\nGovernment has violated my rights,\u201d and it would then be\r\navailable to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue\r\nthat might be relevant to that claim\u2019s disposition. Not\r\nonly the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic rela\u00ad\r\ntionship between litigants and courts, would be upended if\r\nthe latter had free rein to construe the former\u2019s claims at\r\nsuch high levels of generality. There would be no need for\r\nplaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the con\u00ad\r\nstitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the\r\nrest to us.9\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  8 The majority\u2019s \u201cchilling\u201d argument is particularly inapposite with\r\n\r\nrespect to 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b\u2019s longstanding restriction on the use of\r\ncorporate general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was\r\never any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional\r\nequivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what\r\ncounts as express advocacy since the \u201cmagic words\u201d test of Buckley v.\r\nValeo, 424 U. S. 1, 44, n. 52 (1976) (per curiam). Yet even though\r\nCitizens United\u2019s briefs never once mention \u00a7441b\u2019s restriction on\r\nexpress advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate\r\nchilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that Hillary\r\ncounts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to\r\nopine that this statutory provision is \u201cinvalid\u201d as well. Ante, at 50.\r\n  9 The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied\r\n\r\nchallenges does not have \u201csome automatic effect\u201d that mechanically\r\ncontrols the judicial task.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n  Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of\r\nCitizens United\u2019s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is\r\nnecessary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review\r\narticle, it asserts that Citizens United\u2019s dismissal of the\r\nfacial challenge does not prevent us \u201c \u2018from making\r\nbroader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \u201cas\u00ad\r\napplied\u201d cases.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 14 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied\r\nand Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113\r\nHarv. L. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon));\r\naccord, ante, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (\u201cRegardless\r\nwhether we label Citizens United\u2019s claim a \u2018facial\u2019 or \u2018as\u00ad\r\napplied\u2019 challenge, the consequences of the Court\u2019s deci\u00ad\r\nsion are the same\u201d). The majority is on firmer conceptual\r\nground here. Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor\r\nFallon\u2019s thesis, one must proceed to ask which as-applied\r\nchallenges, if successful, will \u201cproperly\u201d invite or entail\r\ninvalidation of the underlying statute.10 The paradigmatic\r\ncase is a judicial determination that the legislature acted\r\nwith an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as\r\nthis carries the necessary implication that all future as\u00ad\r\napplied challenges to the provision must prevail. See\r\nFallon 1339\u20131340.\r\n  Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge was not of this\r\nsort. Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention\r\nwas that BCRA \u00a7203 could not lawfully be applied to a\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ninvert it.\r\n  10 Professor Fallon proposes an intricate answer to this question that\r\n\r\nthe majority ignores. Fallon 1327\u20131359. It bears mention that our\r\ncolleagues have previously cited Professor Fallon\u2019s article for the exact\r\nopposite point from the one they wish to make today. In Gonzales v.\r\nCarhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007), the Court explained that \u201c[i]t is neither\r\nour obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve\r\nquestions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation\r\nthat might develop,\u201d and \u201c[f]or this reason, \u2018[a]s-applied challenges are\r\nthe basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 168\r\n(opinion for the Court by KENNEDY, J.)

S. C. \u00a7501(c)(4)11 and funded overwhelmingly by indi\u00ad\r\nviduals (such as itself). See Brief for Appellant 16\u201341.\r\nSuccess on either of these claims would not necessarily\r\ncarry any implications for the validity of \u00a7203 as applied to\r\nother types of broadcasts, other types of corporations, or\r\nunions. It certainly would not invalidate the statute as\r\napplied to a large for-profit corporation. See Tr. of Oral\r\nArg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United\r\nemphasizing that appellant is \u201ca small, nonprofit organi\u00ad\r\nzation, which is very much like [an MCFL corporation],\u201d\r\nand affirming that its argument \u201cdefinitely would not be\r\nthe same\u201d if Hillary were distributed by General Motors).12\r\nThere is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial chal\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  11 Internal   Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) applies, inter alia, to non\u00ad\r\nprofit organizations \u201coperated exclusively for the promotion of social\r\nwelfare, . . . the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to chari\u00ad\r\ntable, educational, or recreational purposes.\u201d\r\n   12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE is therefore much too quick when he suggests\r\n\r\nthat, \u201c[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case\r\nthat the Act may not be applied to Citizens United\u2014because corpora\u00ad\r\ntions as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment\r\nrights\u2014would mean that any other corporation raising the same\r\nchallenge would also win.\u201d Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion). That\r\nconclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens\r\nUnited\u2019s plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implau\u00ad\r\nsible position that all corporations and all types of expenditures enjoy\r\nthe same First Amendment protections, which always trump the\r\ninterests in regulation. At times, the majority appears to endorse this\r\nextreme view. At other times, however, it appears to suggest that\r\nnonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protec\u00ad\r\ntion than for-profit corporations, see ante, at 20, 39, \u201cadvocacy\u201d organi\u00ad\r\nzations have a better claim than other nonprofits, ante, at 20, domestic\r\ncorporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, ante, at 46\u2013\r\n47, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations,\r\nante, at 38\u201340, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast\r\ncommunications, ante, at 33.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nlenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.\r\nNarrower Grounds\r\n   It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have\r\nmanufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have\r\nadvanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would\r\nfacilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corpora\u00ad\r\ntions such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes\r\nand precedents. Which is to say, the majority has trans\u00ad\r\ngressed yet another \u201ccardinal\u201d principle of the judicial\r\nprocess: \u201c[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is neces\u00ad\r\nsary not to decide more,\u201d PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug En\r\nforcement Admin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (Rob\u00ad\r\nerts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\r\n   Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision\r\nthat the majority has bypassed. First, the Court could\r\nhave ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length\r\nfilm distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify\r\nas an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d under \u00a7203 of\r\nBCRA, 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441b. BCRA defines that term to en\u00ad\r\ncompass certain communications transmitted by \u201cbroad\u00ad\r\ncast, cable, or satellite.\u201d \u00a7434(f)(3)(A). When Congress\r\nwas developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was\r\nstill in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very\r\ndifferent sort of programming: short advertisements run\r\non television or radio. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207.\r\nThe sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC\u2019s im\u00ad\r\nplementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on\u00ad\r\ndemand transmissions.          See Brief for Senator John\r\nMcCain et al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201319. In light of this\r\nambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on\u00ad\r\ndemand, and \u201c[t]he elementary rule . . . that every reason\u00ad\r\nable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a\r\nstatute from unconstitutionality,\u201d Hooper v. California,\r\n155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that de minimis\r\nbusiness support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise\r\nqualifying organization from the ambit of MCFL.14 This\r\nCourt could have simply followed their lead.15\r\n   Finally, let us not forget Citizens United\u2019s as-applied\r\nconstitutional challenge.      Precisely because Citizens\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   13 The Court entirely ignores this statutory argument. It concludes\r\n\r\nthat \u00a7203 applies to Hillary on the basis of the film\u2019s content, ante, at\r\n7\u20138, without considering the possibility that \u00a7203 does not apply to\r\nvideo-on-demand transmissions generally.\r\n   14 See Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F. 3d 1137,\r\n\r\n1148 (CA10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that \u201cevery other\r\ncircuit to have addressed this issue\u201d has done likewise); Brief for\r\nIndependent Sector as Amicus Curiae 10\u201311 (collecting cases). The\r\nCourt rejects this solution in part because the Government \u201cmerely\r\nsuggest[s] it\u201d and \u201cdoes not say that it agrees with the interpretation.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 11. Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing\r\ninsufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same\r\ntime that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly\r\nabandoned. The Court also protests that a de minimis standard would\r\n\u201crequir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.\u201d Ante, at 12. But de\r\nminimis tests need not be intricate at all. A test that granted MCFL\r\nstatus to \u00a7501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed\r\ndollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such\r\ndonations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets,\r\nwould be perfectly easy to understand and administer.\r\n   15 Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have\r\n\r\nbeen to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA \u00a7203(c),\r\nallowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering com\u00ad\r\nmunications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace\r\nthe payments to individual contributions. See Brief for National Rifle\r\nAssociation as Amicus Curiae 5\u201315 (arguing forcefully that Congress\r\nintended this result).\r\n\f16     CITIZENS UNITED v.

As the appellant\u2019s own\r\narguments show, the Court could have easily limited the\r\nbreadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to\r\nadopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must\r\nalways be treated identically\u2014and always spared expendi\u00ad\r\ntures restrictions\u2014in the political realm. Yet the Court\r\nnonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review proc\u00ad\r\ness that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation\r\nsince Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and\r\nthat was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in\r\nWRTL, 551 U. S. 449.\r\n  This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case\r\ncould have been decided is not meant to show that any of\r\nthese grounds is ideal, though each is perfectly \u201cvalid,\u201d\r\nante, at 12 (majority opinion).16 It is meant to show that\r\nthere were principled, narrower paths that a Court that\r\nwas serious about judicial restraint could have taken.\r\nThere was also the straightforward path: applying Austin\r\nand McConnell, just as the District Court did in holding\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  16 THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds our discussion of these narrower solutions\r\n\u201cquite perplexing\u201d because we suggest that the Court should \u201clatch on\r\nto one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional\r\nquestion,\u201d without doing the same ourselves. Ante, at 3. There is\r\nnothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly\r\nsituated to our colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view\r\nof the First Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not\r\nlead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this\r\ncase, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional\r\navoidance or to vindicate Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge. Each\r\nof the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statu\u00ad\r\ntory argument the Court accepted in last year\u2019s Voting Rights Act case,\r\nNorthwest Austin Municipal Util.

No such\r\njustification exists in this case, and to the contrary there\r\nare powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our\r\nprecedents.17\r\n   The Court\u2019s central argument for why stare decisis\r\nought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin. The\r\nopinion \u201cwas not well reasoned,\u201d our colleagues assert, and\r\nit conflicts with First Amendment principles. Ante, at 47\u2013\r\n48. This, of course, is the Court\u2019s merits argument, the\r\nmany defects in which we will soon consider. I am per\u00ad\r\nfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were\r\ndead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest\r\nof our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for\r\nrevisiting it. But neither is true of Austin, as I explain at\r\nlength in Parts III and IV, infra, at 23\u201389, and restating a\r\nmerits argument with additional vigor does not give it\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  17 I\r\n     will have more to say shortly about the merits\u2014about why Austin\r\nand McConnell are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and\r\nwhy their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present\r\npurposes, I limit the discussion to stare-decisis-specific considerations.\r\n\f18     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nextra weight in the stare decisis calculus.\r\n   Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supple\u00ad\r\nments its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The\r\nCourt proclaims that \u201cAustin is undermined by experience\r\nsince its announcement.\u201d Ante, at 48. This is a curious\r\nclaim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The\r\nmajority has no empirical evidence with which to substan\u00ad\r\ntiate the claim; we just have its ipse dixit that the real\r\nworld has not been kind to Austin. Nor does the majority\r\nbother to specify in what sense Austin has been \u201cunder\u00ad\r\nmined.\u201d Instead it treats the reader to a string of non\r\nsequiturs: \u201cOur Nation\u2019s speech dynamic is changing,\u201d\r\nante, at 48; \u201c[s]peakers have become adept at presenting\r\ncitizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted\r\nmessages,\u201d ibid.; \u201c[c]orporations . . . do not have monolithic\r\nviews,\u201d ibid. How any of these ruminations weakens the\r\nforce of stare decisis, escapes my comprehension.18\r\n   The majority also contends that the Government\u2019s hesi\u00ad\r\ntation to rely on Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale \u201cdimin\u00ad\r\nishe[s]\u201d \u201cthe principle of adhering to that precedent.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 48; see also ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)\r\n(Government\u2019s litigating position is \u201cmost importan[t]\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   18 THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that Austin has been undermined by\r\n\r\nsubsequent dissenting opinions. Ante, at 9. Under this view, it appears\r\nthat the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of\r\nrequests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. THE CHIEF\r\nJUSTICE further suggests that Austin \u201cis uniquely destabilizing because\r\nit threatens to subvert our Court\u2019s decisions even outside\u201d its particular\r\nfacts, as when we applied its reasoning in McConnell. Ante, at 9. Once\r\nagain, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the\r\nmore we call it into question. For those who believe Austin was cor\u00ad\r\nrectly decided\u2014as the Federal Government and the States have long\r\nbelieved, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since\r\nAustin have believed, and as we continue to believe\u2014there is nothing\r\n\u201cdestabilizing\u201d about the prospect of its continued application. It is\r\ngutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does\r\ntoday, that will be destabilizing.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

We have never thought\r\nfit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken\r\nany particular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can\r\noften be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may\r\nhave strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing\r\nonly a subset of them. Members of the public, moreover,\r\noften rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our\r\nprecise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legisla\u00ad\r\ntures that have been regulating corporate electioneering\r\nsince Austin. The task of evaluating the continued viabil\u00ad\r\nity of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.19\r\n   Although the majority opinion spends several pages\r\nmaking these surprising arguments, it says almost noth\u00ad\r\ning about the standard considerations we have used to\r\ndetermine stare decisis value, such as the antiquity of the\r\nprecedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reli\u00ad\r\nance interests at stake. It is also conspicuously silent\r\nabout McConnell, even though the McConnell Court\u2019s\r\ndecision to uphold BCRA \u00a7203 relied not only on the anti\u00ad\r\ndistortion logic of Austin but also on the statute\u2019s histori\u00ad\r\ncal pedigree, see, e.g., 540 U. S., at 115\u2013132, 223\u2013224, and\r\nthe need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns,\r\nsee id., at 126\u2013129, 205\u2013208, and n. 88.\r\n   We have recognized that \u201c[s]tare decisis has special force\r\nwhen legislators or citizens \u2018have acted in reliance on a\r\nprevious decision, for in this instance overruling the deci\u00ad\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   19 Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging\r\n\r\nthe historical account of campaign finance law given in United States v.\r\nAutomobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567 (1957). Ante, at 48. Austin did not\r\nso much as allude to this historical account, much less rely on it. Even\r\nif the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign\r\nfinance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than\r\nAutomobile Workers suggested, the point remains that this body of law\r\nhas played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political\r\nlife for decades upon decades.\r\n\f20     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Stare decisis protects not only personal rights\r\ninvolving property or contract but also the ability of the\r\nelected branches to shape their laws in an effective and\r\ncoherent fashion. Today\u2019s decision takes away a power\r\nthat we have long permitted these branches to exercise.\r\nState legislatures have relied on their authority to regu\u00ad\r\nlate corporate electioneering, confirmed in Austin, for\r\nmore than a century.20 The Federal Congress has relied\r\non this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it\r\nspecifically relied on Austin throughout the years it spent\r\ndeveloping and debating BCRA. The total record it com\u00ad\r\npiled was 100,000 pages long.21 Pulling out the rug be\u00ad\r\nneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of\r\n\u00a7203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal\r\nbranch.\r\n   By removing one of its central components, today\u2019s\r\nruling makes a hash out of BCRA\u2019s \u201cdelicate and intercon\u00ad\r\nnected regulatory scheme.\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 172.\r\nConsider just one example of the distortions that will\r\nfollow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from\r\nsoliciting or spending \u201csoft money,\u201d funds that are not\r\nsubject to the statute\u2019s disclosure requirements or its\r\nsource and amount limitations. 2 U.

The\r\nCourt\u2019s ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of\r\ncorporations and unions\u2014and the narrow interests they\r\nrepresent\u2014vis-\u00e0-vis the role of political parties\u2014and the\r\nbroad coalitions they represent\u2014in determining who will\r\nhold public office.22\r\n   Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other stare\r\ndecisis factors also cut against the Court. Considerations\r\nof antiquity are significant for similar reasons. McConnell\r\nis only six years old, but Austin has been on the books for\r\ntwo decades, and many of the statutes called into question\r\nby today\u2019s opinion have been on the books for a half\u00ad\r\ncentury or more. The Court points to no intervening\r\nchange in circumstances that warrants revisiting Austin.\r\nCertainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided\r\nWRTL two Terms ago. And the Court gives no reason to\r\nthink that Austin and McConnell are unworkable.\r\n   In fact, no one has argued to us that Austin\u2019s rule has\r\nproved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corpora\u00ad\r\ntion, union, or State has asked us to overrule it. Quite to\r\nthe contrary, leading groups representing the business\r\ncommunity,23 organized labor,24 and the nonprofit sector,25\r\ntogether with more than half of the States,26 urge that we\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   22 To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the\r\n\r\nimbalance by removing BCRA\u2019s soft-money limits. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg.\r\n24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of KENNEDY, J.). But this is no response to any\r\nlegislature that takes campaign finance regulation seriously.

As for McConnell, the portions of BCRA\r\nit upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Govern\u00ad\r\nment have worked to make \u00a7203 as user-friendly as possi\u00ad\r\nble. For instance, Congress established a special mecha\u00ad\r\nnism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see\r\nnote following 2 U. S. C. \u00a7437h; the FEC has established a\r\nstandardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors,\r\nfor corporations to claim that a particular electioneering\r\ncommunication is permissible under WRTL, see 11 CFR\r\n\u00a7114.15 (2009);27 and, as noted above, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\r\ncrafted his controlling opinion in WRTL with the express\r\ngoal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 469\u2013470, 473\u2013474. The case for stare decisis may be\r\nbolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings \u201chave\r\nreduced the impact\u201d of a precedent \u201cwhile reaffirming the\r\ndecision\u2019s core ruling.\u201d Dickerson v.

In the brief interval between the\r\nestablishment of this process and the 2008 election, corporations and\r\nunions used it to make $108.5 million in electioneering communications.\r\nSupp. Brief for Appellee 22\u201323; FEC, Electioneering Communication\r\nSummary, online at http://fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ECSummary.shtml\r\n(all Internet materials as visited Jan. 18, 2010, and available in Clerk\r\nof Court\u2019s case file).\r\n   28 Concedely, Austin and McConnell were constitutional decisions,\r\n\r\nand we have often said that \u201cclaims of stare decisis are at the weakest\r\nin that field, where our mistakes cannot be corrected by Congress.\u201d\r\nVieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 305 (2004) (plurality opinion). As a\r\ngeneral matter, this principle is a sound one. But the principle only\r\ntakes on real force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal\r\ndemocratic process; it is the fear of making \u201cmistakes [that] cannot be\r\ncorrected by Congress,\u201d ibid., that motivates us to review constitutional\r\nprecedents with a more critical eye. Austin and McConnell did not\r\nobstruct state or congressional legislative power in any way. Although\r\nit is unclear how high a bar today\u2019s decision will pose to future at\u00ad\r\ntempts to regulate corporate electioneering, it will clearly restrain\r\nmuch legislative action.\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

Virtually every one of its arguments\r\nwas made and rejected in those cases, and the majority\r\nopinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated\r\ndissents. The only relevant thing that has changed since\r\nAustin and McConnell is the composition of this Court.\r\nToday\u2019s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of stare decisis,\r\n\u201cthe means by which we ensure that the law will not\r\nmerely change erratically, but will develop in a principled\r\nand intelligible fashion\u201d that \u201cpermits society to presume\r\nthat bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than\r\nin the proclivities of individuals.\u201d Vasquez v.

S. 254, 265 (1986).\r\n                            III\r\n  The novelty of the Court\u2019s procedural dereliction and its\r\napproach to stare decisis is matched by the novelty of its\r\nruling on the merits. The ruling rests on several premises.\r\nFirst, the Court claims that Austin and McConnell have\r\n\u201cbanned\u201d corporate speech. Second, it claims that the\r\nFirst Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based\r\non speaker identity, including the speaker\u2019s identity as a\r\ncorporation. Third, it claims that Austin and McConnell\r\nwere radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition\r\nand our campaign finance jurisprudence. Each of these\r\nclaims is wrong.\r\nThe So-Called \u201cBan\u201d\r\n  Pervading the Court\u2019s analysis is the ominous image of\r\na \u201ccategorical ba[n]\u201d on corporate speech.

For starters, both statutes provide exemptions\r\nfor PACs, separate segregated funds established by a\r\ncorporation for political purposes.         See 2 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7169.255 (West\r\n2005). \u201cThe ability to form and administer separate seg\u00ad\r\nregated funds,\u201d we observed in McConnell, \u201chas provided\r\ncorporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient\r\nopportunity to engage in express advocacy. That has been\r\nthis Court\u2019s unanimous view.\u201d 540 U. S., at 203.\r\n   Under BCRA, any corporation\u2019s \u201cstockholders and their\r\nfamilies and its executive or administrative personnel and\r\ntheir families\u201d can pool their resources to finance election\u00ad\r\neering communications. 2 U.

A\r\nsignificant and growing number of corporations avail\r\nthemselves of this option;29 during the most recent election\r\ncycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion\r\ndollars.30 Administering a PAC entails some administra\u00ad\r\ntive burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer,\r\ndisclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court\r\ntoday upholds, see ante, at 51, and no one has suggested\r\nthat the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit\r\ncorporation.

Like all other natural persons, every shareholder\r\nof every corporation remains entirely free under Austin\r\nand McConnell to do however much electioneering she\r\npleases outside of the corporate form. The owners of a\r\n\u201cmom & pop\u201d store can simply place ads in their own\r\nnames, rather than the store\u2019s. If ideologically aligned\r\nindividuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through\r\nthe corporate form, they may utilize an MCFL organiza\u00ad\r\ntion that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit\r\nfor business or union interests.

Laws such as \u00a7203 target a class of\r\ncommunications that is especially likely to corrupt the\r\npolitical process, that is at least one degree removed from\r\nthe views of individual citizens, and that may not even\r\nreflect the views of those who pay for it. Such laws burden\r\npolitical speech, and that is always a serious matter,\r\ndemanding careful scrutiny. But the majority\u2019s incessant\r\ntalk of a \u201cban\u201d aims at a straw man.\r\nIdentity-Based Distinctions\r\n  The second pillar of the Court\u2019s opinion is its assertion\r\nthat \u201cthe Government cannot restrict political speech\r\nbased on the speaker\u2019s . . . identity.\u201d Ante, at 30; accord,\r\nante, at 1, 24, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 49, 50. The case on\r\nwhich it relies for this proposition is First Nat. Bank of\r\nBoston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978). As I shall explain,\r\ninfra, at 52\u201355, the holding in that case was far narrower\r\nthan the Court implies. Like its paeans to unfettered\r\ndiscourse, the Court\u2019s denunciation of identity-based\r\ndistinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures\r\nreality.\r\n  \u201cOur jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected\r\nan absolutist interpretation\u201d of the First Amendment.\r\nWRTL, 551 U.

Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that\r\nspeech can be regulated differentially on account of the\r\nspeaker\u2019s identity, when identity is understood in cate\u00ad\r\ngorical or institutional terms. The Government routinely\r\nplaces special restrictions on the speech rights of stu\u00ad\r\ndents,41 prisoners,42 members of the Armed Forces,43 for\u00ad\r\neigners,44 and its own employees.45 When such restric\u00ad\r\ntions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest,\r\nthey do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.46 In\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  41 See, e.g., Bethel School Dist.

Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Min\r\nnesota Comm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585 (1983)\r\n(\u201c[D]ifferential treatment\u201d is constitutionally suspect\r\n\u201cunless justified by some special characteristic\u201d of the\r\nregulated class of speakers (emphasis added)), and that\r\nthe constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers,\r\nin certain contexts, \u201c \u2018are not automatically coextensive\r\nwith the rights\u2019 \u201d that are normally accorded to members of\r\nour society, Morse v.

S. 675, 682 (1986)).\r\n   The free speech guarantee thus does not render every\r\nother public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a\r\nspeaker\u2019s autonomy; society could scarcely function if it\r\ndid. It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine\r\nhas \u201cfrowned on\u201d certain identity-based distinctions, Los\r\nAngeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp.,\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ncause they \u201cstand only for the proposition that there are certain gov\u00ad\r\nernmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on\r\nparticular kinds of speech.\u201d Ante, at 25. The majority\u2019s creative sug\u00ad\r\ngestion that these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite\r\nimplausible. In any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case,\r\nas Congress and half the state legislatures have concluded, over many\r\ndecades, that their core functions of administering elections and pass\u00ad\r\ning legislation cannot operate effectively without some narrow restric\u00ad\r\ntions on corporate electioneering paid for by general treasury funds.\r\n   47 Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity\r\n\r\nand incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his\r\nspeech. See Aristotle, Poetics 43\u201344 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (\u201cIn\r\nevaluating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just\r\nthe moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the iden\u00ad\r\ntity of the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and\r\nthe motive\u201d). The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper\r\nsubject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer\r\nand disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have\r\nprohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or\r\ncontent. Not even close.\r\n   The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the\r\nCourt, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely\r\nguards political speech. But in this context, too, the au\u00ad\r\nthority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regula\u00ad\r\ntions based on content and identity is well settled. We\r\nhave, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to ex\u00ad\r\nclude independent candidates from televised debates.\r\nArkansas Ed. Television Comm\u2019n v. Forbes, 523 U.

These statutes burden the political expression of\r\none class of speakers, namely, civil servants. Yet we have\r\nsustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and\r\nCongress\u2019 reasoned judgment that certain regulations\r\nwhich leave \u201cuntouched full participation . . . in political\r\ndecisions at the ballot box,\u201d Civil Service Comm\u2019n v.

NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210.50 Not\r\nonly has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt\r\nthe electoral process long been recognized, but within the\r\narea of campaign finance, corporate spending is also \u201cfur\u00ad\r\nthest from the core of political expression, since corpora\u00ad\r\ntions\u2019 First Amendment speech and association interests\r\nare derived largely from those of their members and of the\r\npublic in receiving information,\u201d Beaumont, 539 U.

Campaign finance distinctions\r\nbased on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in\r\nother words, because the \u201cspeakers\u201d are not natural per\u00ad\r\nsons, much less members of our political community, and\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  50 They are likewise entitled to regulate media corporations differ\u00ad\r\n\r\nently from other corporations \u201cto ensure that the law \u2018does not hinder or\r\nprevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing\r\neditorials about, newsworthy events.\u2019 \u201d McConnell, 540 U.

Fur\u00ad\r\nthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished\r\nfrom noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that\r\nregulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimina\u00ad\r\ntion or political favoritism.\r\n   If taken seriously, our colleagues\u2019 assumption that the\r\nidentity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government\u2019s\r\nability to regulate political speech would lead to some\r\nremarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have\r\naccorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by\r\n\u201cTokyo Rose\u201d during World War II the same protection as\r\nspeech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would\r\nappear to afford the same protection to multinational\r\ncorporations controlled by foreigners as to individual\r\nAmericans: To do otherwise, after all, could \u201c \u2018enhance the\r\nrelative voice\u2019 \u201d of some (i.e., humans) over others (i.e.,\r\nnonhumans).

Such measures have been a part of U. S. campaign finance law\r\nfor many years. The notion that Congress might lack the authority to\r\ndistinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering\r\nwould certainly have surprised the Framers, whose \u201cobsession with\r\nforeign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individu\u00ad\r\nals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country.\u201d\r\nTeachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.

Only the most wooden approach to the\r\nFirst Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it\r\nseeks to draw.\r\nOur First Amendment Tradition\r\n  A third fulcrum of the Court\u2019s opinion is the idea that\r\nAustin and McConnell are radical outliers, \u201caberration[s],\u201d\r\nin our First Amendment tradition. Ante, at 39; see also\r\nante, at 45, 56 (professing fidelity to \u201cour law and our\r\ntradition\u201d). The Court has it exactly backwards. It is\r\ntoday\u2019s holding that is the radical departure from what\r\nhad been settled First Amendment law. To see why, it is\r\nuseful to take a long view.\r\n                1. Original Understandings\r\n  Let us start from the beginning. The Court invokes\r\n\u201cancient First Amendment principles,\u201d ante, at 1 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted), and original understandings,\r\nante, at 37\u201338, to defend today\u2019s ruling, yet it makes only\r\na perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the princi\u00ad\r\nples or understandings of those who drafted and ratified\r\nthe Amendment. Perhaps this is because there is not a\r\nscintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  52 See A.

Rev. 2409,\r\n2508\u20132509 (2003). Of course, voting is not speech in a pure or formal\r\nsense, but then again neither is a campaign expenditure; both are\r\nnevertheless communicative acts aimed at influencing electoral out\u00ad\r\ncomes.

To the extent that the Framers\u2019 views\r\nare discernible and relevant to the disposition of this case,\r\nthey would appear to cut strongly against the majority\u2019s\r\nposition.\r\n  This is not only because the Framers and their contem\u00ad\r\nporaries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now\r\nthink of it, see Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First\r\nAmendment Problems, 47 Ind. L. J. 1, 22 (1971), but also\r\nbecause they held very different views about the nature of\r\nthe First Amendment right and the role of corporations in\r\nsociety. Those few corporations that existed at the found\u00ad\r\ning were authorized by grant of a special legislative char\u00ad\r\nter.53 Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature,\r\nand the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter\r\nthat specified the corporation\u2019s powers and purposes and\r\n\u201cauthoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate\r\norganization,\u201d including \u201cthe internal structure of the\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  53 Scholars  have found that only a handful of business corporations\r\nwere issued charters during the colonial period, and only a few hundred\r\nduring all of the 18th century. See E. Dodd, American Business Corpo\u00ad\r\nrations Until 1860, p. 197 (1954); L. Friedman, A History of American\r\nLaw 188\u2013189 (2d ed. 1985); Baldwin, American Business Corporations\r\nBefore 1789, 8 Am. Hist. Rev. 449, 450\u2013459 (1903). JUSTICE SCALIA\r\nquibbles with these figures; whereas we say that \u201ca few hundred\u201d\r\ncharters were issued to business corporations during the 18th century,\r\nhe says that the number is \u201capproximately 335.\u201d Ante, at 2 (concurring\r\nopinion). JUSTICE SCALIA also raises the more serious point that it is\r\nimproper to assess these figures by today\u2019s standards, ante, at 3,\r\nthough I believe he fails to substantiate his claim that \u201cthe corporation\r\nwas a familiar figure in American economic life\u201d by the century\u2019s end,\r\nibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). His formulation of that claim\r\nis also misleading, because the relevant reference point is not 1800 but\r\nthe date of the First Amendment\u2019s ratification, in 1791. And at that\r\ntime, the number of business charters must have been significantly\r\nsmaller than 335, because the pace of chartering only began to pick up\r\nsteam in the last decade of the 18th century. More than half of the\r\ncentury\u2019s total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800.\r\nFriedman, History of American Law, at 189.\r\n\f36     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Unlike our colleagues, they had little\r\ntrouble distinguishing corporations from human beings,\r\nand when they constitutionalized the right to free speech\r\nin the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individ\u00ad\r\nual Americans that they had in mind.55 While individuals\r\nmight join together to exercise their speech rights, busi\u00ad\r\nness corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facili\u00ad\r\ntating such associational or expressive ends. Even \u201cthe\r\nnotion that business corporations could invoke the First\r\nAmendment would probably have been quite a novelty,\u201d\r\ngiven that \u201cat the time, the legitimacy of every corporate\r\nactivity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the\r\nsovereign.\u201d Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate\r\nSpeech, 18 Hastings Const.

See, e.g., 2 S.

Speech was given\r\nto man by his Creator for the noblest purposes\u201d). Indeed, it has been\r\n\u201cclaimed that the notion of institutional speech . . . did not exist in post\u00ad\r\nrevolutionary America.\u201d Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment\r\nSpeakers, 100 Nw.

Given that corporations\r\nwere conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical\r\ncapacity to \u201cspeak,\u201d the burden of establishing that the Framers and\r\nratifiers understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to encompass corporate\r\nspeech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.\r\n\f38    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n(1819) (Marshall, C. J.) (\u201cA corporation is an artificial\r\nbeing, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contem\u00ad\r\nplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it pos\u00ad\r\nsesses only those properties which the charter of its crea\u00ad\r\ntion confers upon it\u201d); Eule, Promoting Speaker Diversity:\r\nAustin and Metro Broadcasting, 1990 S. Ct. Rev. 105, 129\r\n(\u201cThe framers of the First Amendment could scarcely have\r\nanticipated its application to the corporation form. That,\r\nof course, ought not to be dispositive. What is compelling,\r\nhowever, is an understanding of who was supposed to be\r\nthe beneficiary of the free speech guaranty\u2014the individ\u00ad\r\nual\u201d). In light of these background practices and under\u00ad\r\nstandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers\r\nbelieved \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d would extend equally to\r\nall corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude\r\nlegislatures from taking limited measures to guard\r\nagainst corporate capture of elections.\r\n   The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse\r\nintellectual sources, communicated through newspapers,\r\nand aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had\r\nexisted in England.

From these (accurate)\r\nobservations, the Court concludes that \u201c[t]he First\r\nAmendment was certainly not understood to condone the\r\nsuppression of political speech in society\u2019s most salient\r\nmedia.\u201d Ibid. This conclusion is far from certain, given\r\nthat many historians believe the Framers were focused on\r\nprior restraints on publication and did not understand the\r\nFirst Amendment to \u201cprevent the subsequent punishment\r\nof such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the\r\npublic welfare.\u201d Near v.

Yet, even if the majority\u2019s conclusion\r\nwere correct, it would tell us only that the First Amend\u00ad\r\nment was understood to protect political speech in certain\r\nmedia. It would tell us little about whether the Amend\u00ad\r\nment was understood to protect general treasury election\u00ad\r\neering expenditures by corporations, and to what extent.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

As a matter of original\r\nmeaning, it likewise seems baseless\u2014unless one evaluates\r\nthe First Amendment\u2019s \u201cprinciples,\u201d ante, at 1, 48, or its\r\n\u201cpurpose,\u201d ante, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), at such a\r\nhigh level of generality that the historical understandings\r\nof the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on\r\nthe judicial task. This case sheds a revelatory light on the\r\nassumption of some that an impartial judge\u2019s application\r\nof an originalist methodology is likely to yield more deter\u00ad\r\nminate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the\r\ndecisional process, than his or her views about sound\r\npolicy.\r\n   JUSTICE SCALIA criticizes the foregoing discussion for\r\nfailing to adduce statements from the founding era show\u00ad\r\ning that corporations were understood to be excluded from\r\nthe First Amendment\u2019s free speech guarantee. Ante, at 1\u2013\r\n2, 9. Of course, JUSTICE SCALIA adduces no statements to\r\nsuggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that\r\nthe contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right\r\nthat the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause\r\nthought they were enshrining. Although JUSTICE SCALIA\r\nmakes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual\u2019s\r\nright to speak entails a right to speak with others for a\r\ncommon cause, cf. MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, he does not ex\u00ad\r\nplain why those two rights must be precisely identical, or\r\nwhy that principle applies to electioneering by corpora\u00ad\r\ntions that serve no \u201ccommon cause.\u201d Ante, at 8. Nothing\r\nin his account dislodges my basic point that members of\r\nthe founding generation held a cautious view of corporate\r\npower and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they\r\n\u201cdespised\u201d corporations, ante, at 2), and that they concep\u00ad\r\ntualized speech in individualistic terms. If no prominent\r\nFramer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would\r\n\f40     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nhave lesser status than individual speech, that may well\r\nbe because the contrary proposition\u2014if not also the very\r\nnotion of \u201ccorporate speech\u201d\u2014was inconceivable.56\r\n   JUSTICE SCALIA also emphasizes the unqualified nature\r\nof the First Amendment text. Ante, at 2, 8. Yet he would\r\nseemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could\r\nhe claim that my purported views on newspapers must\r\ntrack my views on corporations generally? Ante, at 6.57\r\nLike virtually all modern lawyers, JUSTICE SCALIA pre\u00ad\r\nsumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the\r\nExecutive, even though its language refers to Congress\r\nalone. In any event, the text only leads us back to the\r\nquestions who or what is guaranteed \u201cthe freedom of\r\nspeech,\u201d and, just as critically, what that freedom consists\r\nof and under what circumstances it may be limited.\r\nJUSTICE SCALIA appears to believe that because corpora\u00ad\r\ntions are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   56 Postratification practice bolsters the conclusion that the First\r\n\r\nAmendment, \u201cas originally understood,\u201d ante, at 37, did not give corpo\u00ad\r\nrations political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals.\r\nWell into the modern era of general incorporation statutes, \u201c[t]he\r\ncommon law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate politi\u00ad\r\ncal participation,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\r\n819 (1978) (White, J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize any\r\nFirst Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of\r\nthe 20th century, see ante, at 25\u201326 (listing cases).\r\n   57 In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against JUSTICE\r\n\r\nSCALIA, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the\r\nFirst Amendment did draw distinctions\u2014explicit distinctions\u2014between\r\ntypes of \u201cspeakers,\u201d or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court\u2019s\r\nstrongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers\u2019 views on the\r\npress, see ante, at 37\u201338; ante, at 4\u20136 (SCALIA, J., concurring), yet while\r\nthe Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the\r\nFree Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and\r\nhistory highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corpora\u00ad\r\ntion, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special\r\nFirst Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of \u201cidentity\u201d\u00ad\r\nbased distinctions might be permissible after all.

That conclu\u00ad\r\nsion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and\r\nJUSTICE SCALIA fails to explain why the original public\r\nmeaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.\r\n   The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as\r\nBCRA \u00a7203 meshes with the original meaning of the First\r\nAmendment.58 I have given several reasons why I believe\r\nthe Constitution would have been understood then, and\r\nought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restric\u00ad\r\ntions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many\r\nmore reasons in the pages to come. The Court enlists the\r\nFramers in its defense without seriously grappling with\r\ntheir understandings of corporations or the free speech\r\nright, or with the republican principles that underlay\r\nthose understandings.\r\n   In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has\r\nnever attended very closely to the views of the Framers,\r\nsee Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 280 (2006) (STEVENS,\r\nJ., dissenting), whose political universe differed pro\u00ad\r\nfoundly from that of today. We have long since held that\r\ncorporations are covered by the First Amendment, and\r\nmany legal scholars have long since rejected the conces\u00ad\r\nsion theory of the corporation. But \u201chistorical context is\r\nusually relevant,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\r\nted), and in light of the Court\u2019s effort to cast itself as\r\nguardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that\r\nnothing in our constitutional history dictates today\u2019s\r\noutcome.

At the federal level, the express distinction\r\nbetween corporate and individual political spending on\r\nelections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed\r\nthe Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corpo\u00ad\r\nrate contributions to candidates. The Senate Report on\r\nthe legislation observed that \u201c[t]he evils of the use of\r\n[corporate] money in connection with political elections are\r\nso generally recognized that the committee deems it un\u00ad\r\nnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general\r\npurpose of this measure.

J. 871 (2004).\r\n  Over the years, the limitations on corporate political\r\nspending have been modified in a number of ways, as\r\nCongress responded to changes in the American economy\r\nand political practices that threatened to displace the\r\ncommonweal. Justice Souter recently traced these devel\u00ad\r\nopments at length.59 WRTL, 551 U. S., at 507\u2013519 (dis\u00ad\r\nsenting opinion); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 115\u2013\r\n133; McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 188\u2013205. The Taft-\r\nHartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case.\r\nIn that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress\r\nextended the prohibition on corporate support of candi\u00ad\r\ndates to cover not only direct contributions, but independ\u00ad\r\nent expenditures as well. Labor Management Relations\r\nAct, 1947, \u00a7304, 61 Stat. 159. The bar on contributions\r\n\u201cwas being so narrowly construed\u201d that corporations were\r\neasily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting\r\ncandidates through other means. WRTL, 551 U. S., at 511\r\n(Souter, J., dissenting) (citing S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong.,\r\n1st Sess., 38\u201339 (1947)).\r\n  Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the\r\nmiddle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote sepa\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   59 As the majority notes, there is some academic debate about the\r\n\r\nprecise origins of these developments. Ante, at 48; see also n. 19, supra.\r\nThere is always some academic debate about such developments; the\r\nmotives of legislatures are never entirely clear or unitary. Yet the basic\r\nshape and trajectory of 20th-century campaign finance reform are clear,\r\nand one need not take a na\u00efve or triumphalist view of this history to\r\nfind it highly relevant. The Court\u2019s skepticism does nothing to mitigate\r\nthe absurdity of its claim that Austin and McConnell were outliers. Nor\r\ndoes it alter the fact that five Justices today destroy a longstanding\r\nAmerican practice.\r\n\f44         CITIZENS UNITED v.

Ante, at 27\u201328. Two features of these\r\ncases are of far greater relevance. First, those Justices\r\nwere writing separately; which is to say, their position\r\nfailed to command a majority. Prior to today, this was a\r\nfact we found significant in evaluating precedents. Sec\u00ad\r\nond, each case in this line expressed support for the prin\u00ad\r\nciple that corporate and union political speech financed\r\nwith PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organiza\u00ad\r\ntion\u2019s stockholders or members, receives greater protection\r\nthan speech financed with general treasury funds.60\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  60 See Pipefitters v.

S. C.\r\n\u00a7441b(a). FECA codified the option for corporations and\r\nunions to create PACs to finance contributions and expen\u00ad\r\nditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself.\r\n\u00a7441b(b).\r\n   By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on\r\ncorporate contributions and expenditures had become such\r\nan accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation\r\nthat when a large number of plaintiffs, including several\r\nnonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of\r\nthe Act in Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, no one even bothered to\r\nargue that the bar as such was unconstitutional. Buckley\r\nfamously (or infamously) distinguished direct contribu\u00ad\r\ntions from independent expenditures, id., at 58\u201359, but its\r\nsilence on corporations only reinforced the understanding\r\nthat corporate expenditures could be treated differently\r\nfrom individual expenditures. \u201cSince our decision in Buck\r\nley, Congress\u2019 power to prohibit corporations and unions\r\nfrom using funds in their treasuries to finance advertise\u00ad\r\nments expressly advocating the election or defeat of candi\u00ad\r\ndates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our\r\nlaw.\u201d McConnell, 540 U.

In MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, we stated\r\nagain \u201cthat \u2018the special characteristics of the corporate\r\nstructure require particularly careful regulation,\u2019 \u201d id., at\r\n256 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210), and again we\r\nacknowledged that the Government has a legitimate\r\ninterest in \u201cregulat[ing] the substantial aggregations of\r\nwealth amassed by the special advantages which go with\r\nthe corporate form,\u201d 479 U.

Those aggregations can distort the \u201cfree\r\ntrade in ideas\u201d crucial to candidate elections, ibid., at the\r\nexpense of members or shareholders who may disagree\r\nwith the object of the expenditures, id., at 260 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). What the Court held by a 5-to\u00ad\r\n4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be\r\nallowed to use their general treasury funds for independ\u00ad\r\nent expenditures, because Congress\u2019 interests in protect\u00ad\r\ning shareholders and \u201crestrict[ing] \u2018the influence of politi\u00ad\r\ncal war chests funneled through the corporate form,\u2019 \u201d id.,\r\nat 257 (quoting FEC v.

They would have recognized congressional authority\r\nto bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even\r\nby this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that \u201cthe\r\nthreat from corporate political activity will vary depending\r\non the particular characteristics of a given corporation,\u201d\r\nbut believed these \u201cdistinctions among corporations\u201d were\r\n\u201cdistinctions in degree,\u201d not \u201cin kind,\u201d and thus \u201cmore\r\nproperly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.\u201d\r\n479 U. S., at 268 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Not a single Justice suggested\r\nthat regulation of corporate political speech could be no\r\nmore stringent than of speech by an individual.\r\n   Four years later, in Austin, 494 U. S. 652, we considered\r\nwhether corporations falling outside the MCFL exception\r\ncould be barred from using general treasury funds to make\r\nindependent expenditures in support of, or in opposition\r\nto, candidates. We held they could be. Once again recog\u00ad\r\nnizing the importance of \u201cthe integrity of the marketplace\r\nof political ideas\u201d in candidate elections, MCFL, 479 U.

Next, they had to have\r\nno shareholders, so that \u201cpersons connected with the organization will\r\nhave no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree\r\nwith its political activity.\u201d Ibid. Finally, they could not be \u201cestablished\r\nby a business corporation or a labor union,\u201d nor \u201caccept contributions\r\nfrom such entities,\u201d lest they \u201cserv[e] as conduits for the type of direct\r\nspending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\u201d Ibid.\r\n\f48     CITIZENS UNITED v.

In light of the corrupting\r\neffects such spending might have on the political process,\r\nibid., we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corpo\u00ad\r\nrate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations\u2019\r\nPACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus\r\n\u201creflect actual public support for the political ideals es\u00ad\r\npoused by corporations,\u201d ibid.

S., at 153\u2013156, most importantly in McCon\r\nnell, 540 U.

Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\r\n402 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring). For another, the\r\nBuckley Court used this line in evaluating \u201cthe ancillary\r\ngovernmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of\r\nindividuals and groups to influence the outcome of elec\u00ad\r\ntions.\u201d 424 U. S., at 48. It is not apparent why this is\r\nrelevant to the case before us. The majority suggests that\r\nAustin rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization,\r\nante, at 34; ante, at 8\u201310 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), but\r\nwe made it clear in Austin (as in several cases before and\r\nsince) that a restriction on the way corporations spend\r\ntheir money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of\r\nsome elements of our society in preference to others.\r\nIndeed, we expressly ruled that the compelling interest\r\nsupporting Michigan\u2019s statute was not one of \u201c \u2018equaliz[ing]\r\nthe relative influence of speakers on elections,\u2019 \u201d Austin,\r\n494 U. S., at 660 (quoting id., at 705 (KENNEDY, J., dis\u00ad\r\nsenting)), but rather the need to confront the distinctive\r\ncorrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy fi\u00ad\r\nnanced by general treasury dollars, id., at 659\u2013660.\r\n    For that matter, it should go without saying that when\r\nwe made this statement in Buckley, we could not have\r\nbeen casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expendi\u00ad\r\ntures in candidate elections, which had not been chal\u00ad\r\nlenged as \u201cforeign to the First Amendment,\u201d ante, at 33\r\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49), or for any other reason.\r\n\f52    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nBuckley\u2019s independent expenditure analysis was focused\r\non a very different statutory provision, 18 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V). It is implausible to think,\r\nas the majority suggests, ante, at 29\u201330, that Buckley\r\ncovertly invalidated FECA\u2019s separate corporate and union\r\ncampaign expenditure restriction, \u00a7610 (now codified at 2\r\nU. S. C. \u00a7441b), even though that restriction had been on\r\nthe books for decades before Buckley and would remain on\r\nthe books, undisturbed, for decades after.\r\n  The case on which the majority places even greater\r\nweight than Buckley, however, is Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\r\nclaiming it \u201ccould not have been clearer\u201d that Bellotti\u2019s\r\nholding forbade distinctions between corporate and indi\u00ad\r\nvidual expenditures like the one at issue here, ante, at 30.\r\nThe Court\u2019s reliance is odd. The only thing about Bellotti\r\nthat could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the\r\nmajority\u2019s position. Bellotti ruled, in an explicit limitation\r\non the scope of its holding, that \u201cour consideration of a\r\ncorporation\u2019s right to speak on issues of general public\r\ninterest implies no comparable right in the quite different\r\ncontext of participation in a political campaign for election\r\nto public office.\u201d 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26; see also id., at\r\n787\u2013788 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving\r\npublic confidence in Government and protecting dissenting\r\nshareholders may be \u201cweighty . . . in the context of parti\u00ad\r\nsan candidate elections\u201d). Bellotti, in other words, did not\r\ntouch the question presented in Austin and McConnell,\r\nand the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for\r\nwhich the majority cites it.\r\n  The majority attempts to explain away the distinction\r\nBellotti drew\u2014between general corporate speech and\r\ncampaign speech intended to promote or prevent the\r\nelection of specific candidates for office\u2014as inconsistent\r\nwith the rest of the opinion and with Buckley. Ante, at 31,\r\n42\u201344. Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coher\u00ad\r\nent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at\r\n788, n. 26, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate\r\nparticipation in referenda. A referendum cannot owe a\r\npolitical debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a\r\ncorporation, or fear the corporation\u2019s retaliation. Cf. Aus\r\ntin, 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J., concurring); Citizens\r\nAgainst Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berke\r\nley, 454 U. S. 290, 299 (1981). The majority likewise\r\noverlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases\r\nhave repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinc\u00ad\r\ntion. See, e.g., Austin, 494 U. S., at 659; NCPAC, 470\r\nU. S., at 495\u2013496; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal.,\r\n468 U. S. 364, 371, n. 9 (1984); NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210,\r\nn. 7. The Court\u2019s critique of Bellotti\u2019s footnote 26 puts it in\r\nthe strange position of trying to elevate Bellotti to canoni\u00ad\r\ncal status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical\r\npiece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable\r\nwith Buckley. Bellotti, apparently, is both the font of all\r\nwisdom and internally incoherent.\r\n    The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different\r\nfactual situation from the one that confronts us in this\r\ncase: a state statute that barred business corporations\u2019\r\nexpenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifi\u00ad\r\ncally, the statute barred a business corporation \u201cfrom\r\nmaking contributions or expenditures \u2018for the purpose of\r\n. . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question sub\u00ad\r\nmitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting\r\nany of the property, business or assets of the corporation,\u2019 \u201d\r\n435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55,\r\n\u00a78 (West Supp. 1977); alteration in original), and it went\r\nso far as to provide that referenda related to income taxa\u00ad\r\ntion would not \u201c \u2018be deemed materially to affect the prop\u00ad\r\nerty, business or assets of the corporation,\u2019 \u201d 435 U. S., at\r\n768. As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this\r\nstatute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed\r\n\f54    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nstate constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated\r\nincome tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to\r\nprevent corporations from spending money to defeat this\r\namendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators\r\nbut had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. See id., at\r\n769\u2013770, and n. 3. We said that \u201cwhere, as here, the\r\nlegislature\u2019s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to\r\ngive one side of a debatable public question an advantage\r\nin expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment\r\nis plainly offended.\u201d Id., at 785\u2013786 (footnote omitted).\r\n   Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint-discriminatory stat\u00ad\r\nute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even\r\nJustice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that \u201ca\r\nvery persuasive argument could be made that the [Massa\u00ad\r\nchusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal in\u00ad\r\ncome tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the\r\ncombination of the Commonwealth\u2019s referendum provision\r\nand corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax,\r\nsimply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue\r\nso that it could succeed in its desire.\u201d Id., at 827, n. 6. To\r\nmake matters worse, the law at issue did not make any\r\nallowance for corporations to spend money through PACs.\r\nId., at 768, n. 2 (opinion of the Court). This really was a\r\ncomplete ban on a specific, preidentified subject. See\r\nMCFL, 479 U. S., at 259, n. 12 (stating that 2 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure restriction \u201cis of course distinguish\r\nable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for\r\npolitical speech that we invalidated in the state referen\u00ad\r\ndum context in . . . Bellotti\u201d (emphasis added)).\r\n   The majority grasps a quotational straw from Bellotti,\r\nthat speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of\r\nthe First Amendment merely because it comes from a\r\ncorporation. Ante, at 30\u201331. Of course not, but no one\r\nsuggests the contrary and neither Austin nor McConnell\r\nheld otherwise. They held that even though the expendi\u00ad\r\ntures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny,\r\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)             55\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthe restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a\r\ncompelling state interest. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at\r\n205; Austin, 494 U. S., at 658, 660. We acknowledged in\r\nBellotti that numerous \u201cinterests of the highest impor\u00ad\r\ntance\u201d can justify campaign finance regulation. 435 U. S.,\r\nat 788\u2013789. But we found no evidence that these interests\r\nwere served by the Massachusetts law. Id., at 789. We\r\nleft open the possibility that our decision might have been\r\ndifferent if there had been \u201crecord or legislative findings\r\nthat corporate advocacy threatened imminently to under\u00ad\r\nmine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather\r\nthan serving First Amendment interests.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   Austin and McConnell, then, sit perfectly well with\r\nBellotti. Indeed, all six Members of the Austin majority\r\nhad been on the Court at the time of Bellotti, and none so\r\nmuch as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension be\u00ad\r\ntween the decisions. The difference between the cases is\r\nnot that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment\r\nprotection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it.\r\nThe difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti\r\nsmacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of\r\ncorporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State\r\nhas a greater interest in regulating independent corporate\r\nexpenditures on candidate elections than on referenda,\r\nbecause in a functioning democracy the public must have\r\nfaith that its representatives owe their positions to the\r\npeople, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.\r\n                           *     *    *\r\n   In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has\r\ndemonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate\r\nparticipation in candidate elections to \u201c \u2018[p]reserv[e] the\r\nintegrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . .\r\nsustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual\r\ncitizen,\u2019 \u201d protect the expressive interests of shareholders,\r\nand \u201c \u2018[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen\u2019s confidence in\r\n\f56    CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 788\u2013789; first alteration in\r\noriginal). These understandings provided the combined\r\nimpetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see Automobile\r\nWorkers, 352 U. S., at 570\u2013575, the Taft-Hartley Act in\r\n1947, see WRTL, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting),\r\nFECA in 1971, see NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and\r\nBCRA in 2002, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 126\u2013132.\r\nContinuously for over 100 years, this line of \u201c[c]ampaign\r\nfinance reform has been a series of reactions to docu\u00ad\r\nmented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter,\r\nposed by large sums of money from corporate or union\r\ntreasuries.\u201d WRTL, 551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissent\u00ad\r\ning). Time and again, we have recognized these realities\r\nin approving measures that Congress and the States have\r\ntaken. None of the cases the majority cites is to the con\u00ad\r\ntrary. The only thing new about Austin was the dissent,\r\nwith its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of\r\ninterests recognized in the name of democratic integrity\r\nsince the days of the Progressives.\r\n                              IV\r\n   Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in\r\nwhich to revisit Austin and McConnell and why these\r\ndecisions sit perfectly well with \u201cFirst Amendment princi\u00ad\r\nples,\u201d ante, at 1, 48, I come at last to the interests that are\r\nat stake.     The majority recognizes that Austin and\r\nMcConnell may be defended on anticorruption, antidistor\u00ad\r\ntion, and shareholder protection rationales. Ante, at 32\u2013\r\n46. It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these\r\nrationales, which overlap and complement each other, and\r\nin applying them to the case at hand.\r\nThe Anticorruption Interest\r\n  Undergirding the majority\u2019s approach to the merits is\r\nthe claim that the only \u201csufficiently important governmen\u00ad\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

This is the same \u201ccrabbed view of\r\ncorruption\u201d that was espoused by JUSTICE KENNEDY in\r\nMcConnell and squarely rejected by the Court in that case.\r\n540 U. S., at 152. While it is true that we have not always\r\nspoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the\r\napproach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my\r\njudgment. It disregards our constitutional history and the\r\nfundamental demands of a democratic society.\r\n   On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress\u2019\r\nlegitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent\r\non elections from exerting an \u201c \u2018undue influence on an\r\nofficeholder\u2019s judgment\u2019 \u201d and from creating \u201c \u2018the appear\u00ad\r\nance of such influence,\u2019 \u201d beyond the sphere of quid pro quo\r\nrelationships. Id., at 150; see also, e.g., id., at 143\u2013144,\r\n152\u2013154; Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441; Shrink Missouri,\r\n528 U. S., at 389. Corruption can take many forms. Brib\u00ad\r\nery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between\r\nselling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not\r\nkind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from\r\ngiving special preference to those who spent money on\r\none\u2019s behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and\r\nthe majority\u2019s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrange\u00ad\r\nments can be neatly demarcated from other improper\r\ninfluences does not accord with the theory or reality of\r\npolitics. It certainly does not accord with the record Con\u00ad\r\ngress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as\r\na remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with\r\nwhich corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may\r\ngo about scratching each other\u2019s backs\u2014and which amply\r\nsupported Congress\u2019 determination to target a limited set\r\nof especially destructive practices.\r\n   The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge\r\nto BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis,\r\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the\r\n\f58    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ncorrupting consequences of corporate and union independ\u00ad\r\nent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA\u2019s passage.\r\nSee McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 555\u2013560, 622\u2013625; see\r\nalso id., at 804\u2013805, 813, n. 143 (Leon, J.) (indicating\r\nagreement). As summarized in her own words:\r\n        \u201cThe factual findings of the Court illustrate that\r\n     corporations and labor unions routinely notify Mem\u00ad\r\n     bers of Congress as soon as they air electioneering\r\n     communications relevant to the Members\u2019 elections.\r\n     The record also indicates that Members express ap\u00ad\r\n     preciation to organizations for the airing of these elec\u00ad\r\n     tion-related advertisements.       Indeed, Members of\r\n     Congress are particularly grateful when negative is\u00ad\r\n     sue advertisements are run by these organizations,\r\n     leaving the candidates free to run positive advertise\u00ad\r\n     ments and be seen as \u2018above the fray.\u2019 Political con\u00ad\r\n     sultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of\r\n     who is running advertisements on the candidate\u2019s be\u00ad\r\n     half, when they are being run, and where they are be\u00ad\r\n     ing run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that\r\n     these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to\r\n     influence various Members of Congress.\r\n        \u201cThe Findings also demonstrate that Members of\r\n     Congress seek to have corporations and unions run\r\n     these advertisements on their behalf. The Findings\r\n     show that Members suggest that corporations or indi\u00ad\r\n     viduals make donations to interest groups with the\r\n     understanding that the money contributed to these\r\n     groups will assist the Member in a campaign. After\r\n     the election, these organizations often seek credit for\r\n     their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Ameri\u00ad\r\n     cans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other\r\n     organizations that engage in electioneering communi\u00ad\r\n     cations, which benefit specific elected officials, receive\r\n     special consideration from those officials when matters\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Her analysis\r\nshows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of\r\nthe quid pro quo category, as well as the adverse conse\u00ad\r\nquences that all such arrangements may have. There are\r\nthreats of corruption that are far more destructive to a\r\ndemocratic society than the odd bribe. Yet the majority\u2019s\r\nunderstanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impo\u00ad\r\ntent to address all but the most discrete abuses.\r\n   Our \u201cundue influence\u201d cases have allowed the American\r\npeople to cast a wider net through legislative experiments\r\ndesigned to ensure, to some minimal extent, \u201cthat office\u00ad\r\nholders will decide issues . . . on the merits or the desires\r\nof their constituencies,\u201d and not \u201caccording to the wishes of\r\nthose who have made large financial contributions\u201d\u2014or\r\nexpenditures\u2014\u201cvalued by the officeholder.\u201d McConnell,\r\n540 U. S., at 153.63 When private interests are seen to\r\nexert outsized control over officeholders solely on account\r\nof the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns,\r\nthe result can depart so thoroughly \u201cfrom what is pure or\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  63 Cf.Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 389\r\n(2000) (recognizing \u201cthe broader threat from politicians too compliant\r\nwith the wishes of large contributors\u201d). Though discrete in scope, these\r\nexperiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a\r\nchance at functioning effectively and preserving the public\u2019s trust.\r\n\u201cEven if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influ\u00ad\r\nence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such\r\ncorruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.\u201d\r\nMcConnell, 540 U. S., at 153. There should be nothing controversial\r\nabout the proposition that the influence being targeted is \u201cundue.\u201d In a\r\ndemocracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim\r\nof placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the bene\u00ad\r\nfactor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its argu\u00ad\r\nments are seen as especially persuasive.\r\n\f60     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Long before Buckley, we appreciated that \u201c[t]o\r\nsay that Congress is without power to pass appropriate\r\nlegislation to safeguard . . . an election from the improper\r\nuse of money to influence the result is to deny to the na\u00ad\r\ntion in a vital particular the power of self protection.\u201d\r\nBurroughs v.

Even under the majority\u2019s\r\n\u201ccrabbed view of corruption,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 152,\r\nthe Government should not lose this case.\r\n   \u201cThe importance of the governmental interest in pre\u00ad\r\nventing [corruption through the creation of political debts]\r\nhas never been doubted.\u201d Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.\r\nEven in the cases that have construed the anticorruption\r\ninterest most narrowly, we have never suggested that\r\nsuch quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright\r\nvote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct\r\ncrimes. Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which\r\noutside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a\r\nlegislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of,\r\nsome outlay of money the parties have made or will make\r\non behalf of the officeholder. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at\r\n143 (\u201cWe have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to\r\nthe elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In Buckley,\r\nwe expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws\r\nprovided a less restrictive alternative to FECA\u2019s contribu\u00ad\r\ntion limits, noting that such laws \u2018deal[t] with only the\r\nmost blatant and specific attempts of those with money to\r\ninfluence governmental action\u2019 \u201d (quoting 424 U.

It has likewise never been doubted\r\nthat \u201c[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual\r\nquid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appear\u00ad\r\nance of corruption.\u201d Id., at 27.

A democracy cannot func\u00ad\r\ntion effectively when its constituent members believe laws\r\nare being bought and sold.\r\n   In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied\r\nto BCRA \u00a7203, however, they conclude \u201c[t]he anticorrup\u00ad\r\ntion interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in\r\nquestion.\u201d Ante, at 41.\r\n   Although the Court suggests that Buckley compels its\r\nconclusion, ante, at 40\u201344, Buckley cannot sustain this\r\nreading. It is true that, in evaluating FECA\u2019s ceiling on\r\nindependent expenditures by all persons, the Buckley\r\nCourt found the governmental interest in preventing\r\ncorruption \u201cinadequate.\u201d 424 U. S., at 45. But Buckley did\r\nnot evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it\r\nrule out the possibility that a future Court might find\r\notherwise. The opinion reasoned that an expenditure\r\nlimitation covering only express advocacy (i.e., magic\r\nwords) would likely be ineffectual, ibid., a problem that\r\nCongress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that \u201cthe\r\nindependent advocacy restricted by [FECA \u00a7608(e)(1)] does\r\nnot presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent\r\ncorruption comparable to those identified with large cam\u00ad\r\npaign contributions,\u201d id., at 46 (emphasis added). Buckley\r\nexpressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale\r\nmight justify restrictions on independent expenditures at\r\na later date, \u201cbecause it may be that, in some circum\u00ad\r\nstances, \u2018large independent expenditures pose the same\r\ndangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements\r\nas do large contributions.\u2019 \u201d WRTL, 551 U. S., at 478\r\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at\r\n45). Certainly Buckley did not foreclose this possibility\r\nwith respect to electioneering communications made with\r\ncorporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had\r\nno occasion to consider.\r\n   The Austin Court did not rest its holding on quid pro\r\n\f64    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nquo corruption, as it found the broader corruption impli\u00ad\r\ncated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection\r\nrationales a sufficient basis for Michigan\u2019s restriction on\r\ncorporate electioneering. 494 U. S., at 658\u2013660. Concur\u00ad\r\nring in that opinion, I took the position that \u201cthe danger of\r\neither the fact, or the appearance, of quid pro quo rela\u00ad\r\ntionships [also] provides an adequate justification for state\r\nregulation\u201d of these independent expenditures. Id., at 678.\r\nI did not see this position as inconsistent with Buckley\u2019s\r\nanalysis of individual expenditures. Corporations, as a\r\nclass, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the\r\nlegislative process and more directly affected by tax and\r\nappropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny;\r\nthey also have vastly more money with which to try to buy\r\naccess and votes. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating\r\nthat the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1\r\ntrillion during the last election cycle). Business corpora\u00ad\r\ntions must engage the political process in instrumental\r\nterms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The\r\nunparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single\u00ad\r\nminded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make\r\nquid pro quo corruption and its appearance inherently\r\nmore likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups)\r\nspend unrestricted sums on elections.\r\n   It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now\r\nsay that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative\r\nand judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a\r\nsubstantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corpora\u00ad\r\ntions grew more and more adept at crafting \u201cissue ads\u201d to\r\nhelp or harm a particular candidate, these nominally\r\nindependent expenditures began to corrupt the political\r\nprocess in a very direct sense. The sponsors of these ads\r\nwere routinely granted special access after the campaign\r\nwas over; \u201ccandidates and officials knew who their friends\r\nwere,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 129. Many corporate\r\nindependent expenditures, it seemed, had become essen\u00ad\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

In an\r\nage in which money and television ads are the coin of the\r\ncampaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations\r\ndeployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influ\u00ad\r\nence over, public officials.\r\n    The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA\r\nrecord does not contain \u201cdirect examples of votes being\r\nexchanged for . . . expenditures.\u201d Ante, at 45 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). It would have been quite re\u00ad\r\nmarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such\r\nbehavior by its own Members. Proving that a specific vote\r\nwas exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been\r\nnext to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motiva\u00ad\r\ntions, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote.\r\nYet, even if \u201c[i]ngratiation and access . . . are not corrup\u00ad\r\ntion\u201d themselves, ibid., they are necessary prerequisites to\r\nit; they can create both the opportunity for, and the ap\u00ad\r\npearance of, quid pro quo arrangements. The influx of\r\nunlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also\r\ncreates new opportunities for the mirror image of quid pro\r\nquo deals: threats, both explicit and implicit. Starting\r\ntoday, corporations with large war chests to deploy on\r\nelectioneering may find democratically elected bodies\r\nbecoming much more attuned to their interests. The\r\nmajority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong\r\nconclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record pro\u00ad\r\nvides \u201conly scant evidence that independent expenditures\r\n. . . ingratiate,\u201d and that, \u201cin any event,\u201d none of it mat\u00ad\r\nters. Ibid.\r\n    In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly\r\ndocumented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and\r\nexplained its significance under the majority\u2019s own touch\u00ad\r\nstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption ration\u00ad\r\nale, Buckley.

See, e.g.,\r\nid., at 478\u2013479. One former Senator candidly admitted to\r\nthe District Court that \u201c \u2018[c]andidates whose campaigns\r\nbenefit from [phony \u201cissue ads\u201d] greatly appreciate the\r\nhelp of these groups. In fact, Members will also be favora\u00ad\r\nbly disposed to those who finance these groups when they\r\nlater seek access to discuss pending legislation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\r\n556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers). One\r\nprominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontro\u00ad\r\nverted testimony, that \u201c \u2018unregulated expenditures\u2014\r\nwhether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad\r\ncampaigns\u2014can sometimes generate far more influence\r\nthan direct campaign contributions.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting decla\u00ad\r\nration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum,\r\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly found, \u201c[t]he record powerfully dem\u00ad\r\nonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with\r\nthe general treasury funds of labor unions and corpora\u00ad\r\ntions endears those entities to elected officials in a way\r\nthat could be perceived by the public as corrupting.\u201d Id., at\r\n622\u2013623. She concluded that the Government\u2019s interest in\r\npreventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept\r\nwas defined in Buckley, was itself sufficient to uphold\r\nBCRA \u00a7203. 251 F.

Instead we\r\nrelied on the governmental interest in combating the\r\nunique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as\r\nrecognized in Austin\u2019s antidistortion and shareholder\r\nprotection rationales, 540 U. S., at 205 (citing Austin, 494\r\nU. S., at 660), as well as the interest in preventing cir\u00ad\r\ncumvention of contribution limits, 540 U.

Had we felt constrained by the view of\r\ntoday\u2019s Court that quid pro quo corruption and its appear\u00ad\r\nance are the only interests that count in this field, ante, at\r\n32\u201346, we of course would have looked closely at that\r\nissue. And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly re\u00ad\r\nflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found\r\none or both of those interests satisfied and \u00a7203 appropri\u00ad\r\nately tailored to them.\r\n   The majority\u2019s rejection of the Buckley anticorruption\r\nrationale on the ground that independent corporate ex\u00ad\r\npenditures \u201cdo not give rise to [quid pro quo] corruption or\r\nthe appearance of corruption,\u201d ante, at 42, is thus unfair\r\nas well as unreasonable. Congress and outside experts\r\nhave generated significant evidence corroborating this\r\nrationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the\r\nrelevant materials before us is that the Government had\r\nno reason to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge\r\nthe plaintiff had abandoned. The Court cannot both\r\nsua sponte choose to relitigate McConnell on appeal and\r\nthen complain that the Government has failed to substan\u00ad\r\ntiate its case. If our colleagues were really serious about\r\nthe interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, they\r\nwould remand to the District Court with instructions to\r\ncommence evidentiary proceedings.66\r\n   The insight that even technically independent expendi\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   66 In fact, the notion that the \u201celectioneering communications\u201d covered\r\n\r\nby \u00a7203 can breed quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of such\r\ncorruption has only become more plausible since we decided McConnell.\r\nRecall that THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s controlling opinion in WRTL subse\u00ad\r\nquently limited BCRA\u2019s definition of \u201celectioneering communications\u201d\r\nto those that are \u201csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than\r\nas an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\u201d 551 U. S., at\r\n470. The upshot was that after WRTL, a corporate or union expendi\u00ad\r\nture could be regulated under \u00a7203 only if everyone would understand\r\nit as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office. It\r\ndoes not take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy\r\nmight be especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.\r\n\f68    CITIZENS UNITED v.

In\r\nthat case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a\r\ncorporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Vir\u00ad\r\nginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular\r\ncandidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that\r\ncourt. \u201cIn addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory\r\nmaximum        to    Benjamin\u2019s      campaign      committee,\r\nBlankenship donated almost $2.5 million to \u2018And For The\r\nSake Of The Kids,\u2019 \u201d a \u00a7527 corporation that ran ads tar\u00ad\r\ngeting Benjamin\u2019s opponent.

At a time when concerns about\r\nthe conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch,\r\nsee, e.g., O\u2019Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov.\r\n15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et al. as Amici\r\nCuriae 2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of\r\ncorporate and union general treasury spending in these\r\nraces. Perhaps \u201cCaperton motions\u201d will catch some of the\r\nworst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States\r\nthat, after today, may no longer have the ability to place\r\nmodest limits on corporate electioneering even if they\r\nbelieve such limits to be critical to maintaining the integ\u00ad\r\nrity of their judicial systems.\r\nDeference and Incumbent Self-Protection\r\n   Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch\r\nof Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorrup\u00ad\r\ntion rationale without serious analysis.67 Today\u2019s opinion\r\nprovides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Con\u00ad\r\ngress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies\r\nhave offered one: the incentives of the legislators who\r\npassed BCRA.

Moreover,\r\n\u201c[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as\r\nhere, we deal with a congressional judgment that has\r\nremained essentially unchanged throughout a century of\r\ncareful legislative adjustment.\u201d Beaumont, 539 U.

In Amer\u00ad\r\nica, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern cam\u00ad\r\npaign finance, just like all other laws. To apply a level of\r\nscrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating elec\u00ad\r\ntioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self\u00ad\r\ninterest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate\r\nelectioneering.\r\n   This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if\r\nthere were a solid basis for believing that a legislative\r\naction was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents\r\nor that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral\r\nprocess.68 See League of United Latin American Citizens\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n 68 JUSTICE   BREYER has suggested that we strike the balance as fol\u00ad\r\n\f72     CITIZENS UNITED v.

Along\r\nwith our duty to balance competing constitutional con\u00ad\r\ncerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elec\u00ad\r\ntions remain at least minimally open, fair, and competi\u00ad\r\ntive. But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss\r\nCongress\u2019 years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned\r\njudgment on this basis, without first confirming that the\r\nstatute in question was intended to be, or will function as,\r\na restraint on electoral competition. \u201cAbsent record evi\u00ad\r\ndence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a\r\nclass, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate\r\nlegislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restric\u00ad\r\ntions.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 31.\r\n   We have no record evidence from which to conclude that\r\nBCRA \u00a7203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the\r\nCourt today calls into question, reflects or fosters such\r\ninvidious discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that\r\n\u201c \u2018any restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is\r\nequally available to challengers and incumbents tends to\r\nfavor incumbents.\u2019 \u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 249 (opinion\r\nof SCALIA, J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be\r\nturned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by \u00a7203\r\nmight well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents\r\nhave pre-existing relationships with corporations and\r\nunions, and groups that wish to procure legislative bene\u00ad\r\nfits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting\r\nofficeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits\r\nand is statistically likely to retain office. If a corporation\u2019s\r\ngoal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corpo\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nlows: \u201cWe should defer to [the legislature\u2019s] political judgment that\r\nunlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process. But\r\nwe should not defer in respect to whether its solution . . . insulates\r\nlegislators from effective electoral challenge.\u201d Shrink Missouri, 528\r\nU.

Nor do we\r\nhave a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court\u2019s\r\nfailure to cite any empirical research attests. Nor does the\r\nlegislative history give reason for concern.

Rev. 28, 137 (2004). Finally, it is important to remem\u00ad\r\nber just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were\r\nprior to BCRA\u2019s passage. As the Solicitor General aptly\r\nremarked at the time, \u201cthe evidence supports overwhelm\u00ad\r\ningly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under\r\nthe old system just fine.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in McConnell v.\r\nFEC, O.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\n280. The majority cavalierly ignores Congress\u2019 factual\r\nfindings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges\r\nthe validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it\r\neffectively discounts the value of that interest to zero.\r\nThis is quite different from conscientious policing for\r\nimpermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensi\u00ad\r\ntive First Amendment context. It is the denial of Con\u00ad\r\ngress\u2019 authority to regulate corporate spending on\r\nelections.\r\nAustin and Corporate Expenditures\r\n   Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general\r\nsocietal interests at stake in campaign finance regulation,\r\nit also overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by\r\nthe regulation of corporate expenditures. The majority\r\nfails to appreciate that Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale is\r\nitself an anticorruption rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660\r\n(describing \u201ca different type of corruption\u201d), tied to the\r\nspecial concerns raised by corporations. Understood prop\u00ad\r\nerly, \u201cantidistortion\u201d is simply a variant on the classic\r\ngovernmental interest in protecting against improper\r\ninfluences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic\r\nprocess. It is manifestly not just an \u201c \u2018equalizing\u2019 \u201d ideal in\r\ndisguise. Ante, at 34 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48).69\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  69 THE  CHIEF JUSTICE denies this, ante, at 9\u201310, citing scholarship\r\nthat has interpreted Austin to endorse an equality rationale, along with\r\nan article by Justice Thurgood Marshall\u2019s former law clerk that states\r\nthat Marshall, the author of Austin, accepted \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d\r\nand \u201cequalizing access to the political process\u201d as bases for campaign\r\nfinance regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall\u2019s\r\nJurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L. J. 655, 667\u2013668\r\n(2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is fair to say that Austin\r\ncan bear an egalitarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this\r\ncharacterization of Justice Marshall\u2019s beliefs. But the fact that Austin\r\ncan be read a certain way hardly proves THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s charge\r\nthat there is nothing more to it. Many of our precedents can bear\r\nmultiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some \u201cequalizing\u201d\r\nimplications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our\r\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

Antidistortion\r\n   The fact that corporations are different from human\r\nbeings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the\r\nmajority opinion almost completely elides it. Austin set\r\nforth some of the basic differences. Unlike natural per\u00ad\r\nsons, corporations have \u201climited liability\u201d for their owners\r\nand managers, \u201cperpetual life,\u201d separation of ownership\r\nand control, \u201cand favorable treatment of the accumulation\r\nand distribution of assets . . . that enhance their ability to\r\nattract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that\r\nmaximize the return on their shareholders\u2019 investments.\u201d\r\n494 U. S., at 658\u2013659. Unlike voters in U. S. elections,\r\ncorporations may be foreign controlled.70 Unlike other\r\ninterest groups, business corporations have been \u201ceffec\u00ad\r\ntively delegated responsibility for ensuring society\u2019s eco\u00ad\r\nnomic welfare\u201d;71 they inescapably structure the life of\r\nevery citizen. \u201c \u2018[T]he resources in the treasury of a busi\u00ad\r\nness corporation,\u2019 \u201d furthermore, \u201c \u2018are not an indication of\r\npopular support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\r\nat 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U.

The availability of these resources may\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\ntakings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure. More\r\nimportant, the Austin Court expressly declined to rely on a speech\u00ad\r\nequalization rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660, and we have never under\u00ad\r\nstood Austin to stand for such a rationale. Whatever his personal\r\nviews, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that THE\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE suggests he did; indeed, he \u201cwould have viewed it as\r\nirresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale\r\nbased on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would\r\nhave even considered joining,\u201d Garrett, 52 Howard L. J., at 674.\r\n   70 In state elections, even domestic corporations may be \u201cforeign\u201d\u00ad\r\n\r\ncontrolled in the sense that they are incorporated in another jurisdic\u00ad\r\ntion and primarily owned and operated by out-of-state residents.\r\n   71 Regan, Corporate Speech and Civic Virtue, in Debating Democ\u00ad\r\n\r\nracy\u2019s Discontent 289, 302 (A.

S., at 258).72\r\n   It might also be added that corporations have no con\u00ad\r\nsciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires.\r\nCorporations help structure and facilitate the activities of\r\nhuman beings, to be sure, and their \u201cpersonhood\u201d often\r\nserves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not them\u00ad\r\nselves members of \u201cWe the People\u201d by whom and for whom\r\nour Constitution was established.\r\n   These basic points help explain why corporate election\u00ad\r\neering is not only more likely to impair compelling gov\u00ad\r\nernmental interests, but also why restrictions on that\r\nelectioneering are less likely to encroach upon First\r\nAmendment freedoms. One fundamental concern of the\r\nFirst Amendment is to \u201cprotec[t] the individual\u2019s interest\r\nin self-expression.\u201d Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v.\r\nPublic Serv.

It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the\r\ncorporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in\r\nfundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to\r\nregulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its\r\nconcern.

A regulation such as BCRA \u00a7203 may affect the\r\nway in which individuals disseminate certain messages\r\nthrough the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone\r\nfrom speaking in his or her own voice. \u201cWithin the realm\r\nof [campaign spending] generally,\u201d corporate spending is\r\n\u201cfurthest from the core of political expression.\u201d Beaumont,\r\n539 U. S., at 161, n. 8.\r\n   It is an interesting question \u201cwho\u201d is even speaking\r\nwhen a business corporation places an advertisement that\r\nendorses or attacks a particular candidate. Presumably it\r\nis not the customers or employees, who typically have no\r\nsay in such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be\r\nthe shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the\r\nday-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political prefer\u00ad\r\nences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers\r\nor directors of the corporation have the best claim to be\r\nthe ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally\r\nprohibit them from using corporate funds for personal\r\nends. Some individuals associated with the corporation\r\nmust make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that\r\nthese individuals are thereby fostering their self\u00ad\r\nexpression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful.\r\nIt is entirely possible that the corporation\u2019s electoral mes\u00ad\r\nsage will conflict with their personal convictions. Take\r\naway the ability to use general treasury funds for some of\r\nthose ads, and no one\u2019s autonomy, dignity, or political\r\nequality has been impinged upon in the least.\r\n   Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from indi\u00ad\r\nvidual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view\r\nthat a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on\r\nindividuals\u2019 electioneering expenditures in the service of\r\n\f78     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthe governmental interests explained above, and in recog\u00ad\r\nnition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct\r\nrestraints on speech but rather on its financing. See, e.g.,\r\nRandall, 548 U. S., at 273 (dissenting opinion). But those\r\nrestrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the\r\nprimary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is\r\ninvolved. Some of those individuals might feel that they\r\nneed to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particu\u00ad\r\nlar candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral\r\npreferences. This is obviously not the situation with busi\u00ad\r\nness corporations, as their routine practice of giving \u201csub\u00ad\r\nstantial sums to both major national parties\u201d makes pellu\u00ad\r\ncidly clear. McConnell, 540 U. S., at 148. \u201c[C]orporate\r\nparticipation\u201d in elections, any business executive will tell\r\nyou, \u201cis more transactional than ideological.\u201d Supp. Brief\r\nfor Committee for Economic Development as Amicus\r\nCuriae 10.\r\n   In this transactional spirit, some corporations have\r\naffirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their elec\u00ad\r\ntioneering communications. These corporations fear that\r\nofficeholders will shake them down for supportive ads,\r\nthat they will have to spend increasing sums on elections\r\nin an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors,\r\nand that public trust in business will be eroded. See id.,\r\nat 10\u201319. A system that effectively forces corporations to\r\nuse their shareholders\u2019 money both to maintain access to,\r\nand to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ulti\u00ad\r\nmately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corpo\u00ad\r\nrations. It can impose a kind of implicit tax.73\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  73 Not all corporations support BCRA \u00a7203, of course, and not all cor\u00ad\r\n\r\nporations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts.\r\nSome nonprofit corporations are created for an ideological purpose.\r\nSome closely held corporations are strongly identified with a particular\r\nowner or founder. The fact that \u00a7203, like the statute at issue in\r\nAustin, regulates some of these corporations\u2019 expenditures does not\r\ndisturb the analysis above. See 494 U. S., at 661\u2013665.

The Court\u2019s central argument is that\r\nlaws such as \u00a7203 have \u201c \u2018deprived [the electorate] of in\u00ad\r\nformation, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,\u2019 \u201d\r\nante, at 38 (quoting CIO, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J.,\r\nconcurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, \u201cinterferes\r\nwith the \u2018open marketplace\u2019 of ideas protected by the First\r\nAmendment,\u201d ante, at 38 (quoting New York State Bd. of\r\nElections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008)).\r\n  There are many flaws in this argument. If the overrid\u00ad\r\ning concern depends on the interests of the audience,\r\nsurely the public\u2019s perception of the value of corporate\r\nspeech should be given important weight. That perception\r\ntoday is the same as it was a century ago when Theodore\r\nRoosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time,\r\nled to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign ex\u00ad\r\npenditures that is overruled today. See WRTL, 551 U. S.,\r\nat 509\u2013510 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nowners may speak in their own names, rather than the business\u2019, if\r\nthey wish to evade \u00a7203 altogether. Nonprofit corporations that want\r\nto make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they\r\nrefuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to\r\ndisassociate without economic penalty. See MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, 264\r\n(1986). Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a con\u00ad\r\ncern about BCRA\u2019s coverage of nonprofits that have ideological mis\u00ad\r\nsions but lack MCFL status, our colleagues refuse to apply the Snowe-\r\nJeffords Amendment or the lower courts\u2019 de minimis exception to\r\nMCFL.

The distinctive threat to democratic\r\nintegrity posed by corporate domination of politics was\r\nrecognized at \u201cthe inception of the republic\u201d and \u201chas been\r\na persistent theme in American political life\u201d ever since.\r\nRegan 302. It is only certain Members of this Court, not\r\nthe listeners themselves, who have agitated for more cor\u00ad\r\nporate electioneering.\r\n   Austin recognized that there are substantial reasons\r\nwhy a legislature might conclude that unregulated general\r\ntreasury expenditures will give corporations \u201cunfai[r]\r\ninfluence\u201d in the electoral process, 494 U. S., at 660, and\r\ndistort public debate in ways that undermine rather than\r\nadvance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of\r\ncorporations allows them to amass and deploy financial\r\nresources on a scale few natural persons can match. The\r\nstructure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a\r\nline between the corporation\u2019s economic interests and the\r\npolitical preferences of the individuals associated with the\r\ncorporation; the corporation must engage the electoral\r\nprocess with the aim \u201cto enhance the profitability of the\r\ncompany, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a\r\nbroader or conflicting set of priorities,\u201d Brief for American\r\nIndependent Business Alliance as Amicus Curiae 11; see\r\nalso ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis\r\nand Recommendations \u00a72.01(a), p. 55 (1992) (\u201c[A] corpora\u00ad\r\ntion . . . should have as its objective the conduct of busi\u00ad\r\nness activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit\r\nand shareholder gain\u201d). In a state election such as the one\r\nat issue in Austin, the interests of nonresident corpora\u00ad\r\ntions may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of\r\nlocal voters. Consequently, when corporations grab up the\r\nprime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can\r\nflood the market with advocacy that bears \u201clittle or no\r\ncorrelation\u201d to the ideas of natural persons or to any\r\nbroader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660. The\r\nopinions of real people may be marginalized. \u201cThe expen\u00ad\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 259.\r\n  In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorpo\u00ad\r\nrate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow\r\nsoon thereafter. Corporate \u201cdomination\u201d of electioneering,\r\nAustin, 494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that\r\ncorporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn\r\non their televisions and radios before an election and hear\r\nonly corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their\r\ncapacity, as citizens, to influence public policy. A Gov\u00ad\r\nernment captured by corporate interests, they may come\r\nto believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor\r\nwilling to give their views a fair hearing. The predictable\r\nresult is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased\r\nperception that large spenders \u201c \u2018call the tune\u2019 \u201d and a\r\nreduced \u201c \u2018willingness of voters to take part in democratic\r\ngovernance.\u2019 \u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting\r\nShrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390). To the extent that\r\ncorporations are allowed to exert undue influence in elec\u00ad\r\ntoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those\r\nraces may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a\r\ncertain corporation can make or break their reelection\r\nchances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.\r\nOn a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneer\u00ad\r\ning might diminish the ability of citizens to \u201chold officials\r\naccountable to the people,\u201d ante, at 23, and disserve the\r\ngoal of a public debate that is \u201cuninhibited, robust, and\r\nwide-open,\u201d New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.\r\n254, 270 (1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature\r\nis entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored\r\nmeasures in response.\r\n  The majority\u2019s unwillingness to distinguish between\r\ncorporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possi\u00ad\r\nbility that corporations\u2019 \u201cwar chests\u201d and their special\r\n\f82    CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 659,\r\nmay translate into special advantages in the market for\r\nlegislation. When large numbers of citizens have a com\u00ad\r\nmon stake in a measure that is under consideration, it\r\nmay be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on\r\nbehalf of their position. The corporate form, by contrast,\r\n\u201cprovides a simple way to channel rents to only those who\r\nhave paid their dues, as it were. If you do not own stock,\r\nyou do not benefit from the larger dividends or apprecia\u00ad\r\ntion in the stock price caused by the passage of private\r\ninterest legislation.\u201d Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech,\r\nPolitical Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate\r\nCharters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corpora\u00ad\r\ntions, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that\r\nfavor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of\r\nmoney but because of their legal and organizational struc\u00ad\r\nture. Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and\r\nthe door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is\r\n\u201cfar more destructive\u201d than what noncorporations are\r\ncapable of. Ibid. It is for reasons such as these that our\r\ncampaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that\r\n\u201cthe \u2018differing structures and purposes\u2019 of different entities\r\n\u2018may require different forms of regulation in order to\r\nprotect the integrity of the electoral process.\u2019 \u201d NRWC, 459\r\nU. S., at 210 (quoting California Medical Assn., 453 U. S.,\r\nat 201).\r\n   The Court\u2019s facile depiction of corporate electioneering\r\nassumes away all of these complexities. Our colleagues\r\nridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on\r\n\u201cnothing more\u201d than a fear that corporations have a spe\u00ad\r\ncial \u201cability to persuade,\u201d ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS,\r\nC. J.), as if corporations were our society\u2019s ablest debaters\r\nand viewpoint-neutral laws such as \u00a7203 were created to\r\nsuppress their best arguments. In their haste to knock\r\ndown yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore\r\nthe fundamental concerns of the Austin Court and the\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

All of the majority\u2019s theoreti\u00ad\r\ncal arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable\r\nsurface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experi\u00ad\r\nence, \u201cthat there is no such thing as too much speech,\u201d\r\nAustin, 494 U. S., at 695 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).74 If\r\nindividuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to\r\nand contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by any\u00ad\r\none, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no\r\nspecial ability to influence elections apart from the merits\r\nof their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if\r\nlegislators always operated with nothing less than perfect\r\nvirtue; then I suppose the majority\u2019s premise would be\r\nsound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domina\u00ad\r\ntion of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the\r\naverage listener\u2019s exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it\r\nmay diminish citizens\u2019 willingness and capacity to partici\u00ad\r\npate in the democratic process.\r\n   None of this is to suggest that corporations can or\r\nshould be denied an opportunity to participate in election\r\ncampaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a\r\nwork of art such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be\r\nbanned), or to deny that some corporate speech may con\u00ad\r\ntribute significantly to public debate. What it shows,\r\nhowever, is that Austin\u2019s \u201cconcern about corporate domi\u00ad\r\nnation of the political process,\u201d 494 U. S., at 659, reflects\r\nmore than a concern to protect governmental interests\r\noutside of the First Amendment. It also reflects a concern\r\nto facilitate First Amendment values by preserving some\r\nbreathing room around the electoral \u201cmarketplace\u201d of\r\nideas, ante, at 19, 34, 38, 52, 54, the marketplace in which\r\nthe actual people of this Nation determine how they will\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  74 Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, class\u00ad\r\n\r\nroom, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.\r\n\f84    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ngovern themselves. The majority seems oblivious to the\r\nsimple truth that laws such as \u00a7203 do not merely pit the\r\nanticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but\r\nalso pit competing First Amendment values against each\r\nother. There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any\r\neffort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers\r\nagainst the First Amendment rights of listeners. But\r\nwhen the speakers in question are not real people and\r\nwhen the appeal to \u201cFirst Amendment principles\u201d depends\r\nalmost entirely on the listeners\u2019 perspective, ante, at 1, 48,\r\nit becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actu\u00ad\r\nally be affected.\r\n   In critiquing Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale and cam\u00ad\r\npaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues\r\nplace tremendous weight on the example of media corpora\u00ad\r\ntions. See ante, at 35\u201338, 46; ante, at 1, 11 (opinion of\r\nROBERTS, C. J.); ante, at 6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet it is\r\nnot at all clear that Austin would permit \u00a7203 to be ap\u00ad\r\nplied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in\r\nthe text, history, and structure of the First Amendment\r\nbut also in facilitating public discourse; as the Austin\r\nCourt explained, \u201cmedia corporations differ significantly\r\nfrom other corporations in that their resources are devoted\r\nto the collection of information and its dissemination to\r\nthe public,\u201d 494 U. S., at 667. Our colleagues have raised\r\nsome interesting and difficult questions about Congress\u2019\r\nauthority to regulate electioneering by the press, and\r\nabout how to define what constitutes the press. But that\r\nis not the case before us. Section 203 does not apply to\r\nmedia corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is\r\nnot a media corporation. There would be absolutely no\r\nreason to consider the issue of media corporations if the\r\nmajority did not, first, transform Citizens United\u2019s as\u00ad\r\napplied challenge into a facial challenge and, second,\r\ninvent the theory that legislatures must eschew all \u201ciden\u00ad\r\ntity\u201d-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news\r\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   85\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\noutlet exactly the same as General Motors.75 This calls to\r\nmind George Berkeley\u2019s description of philosophers: \u201c[W]e\r\nhave first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.\u201d\r\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, \u00b63\r\n(R. Woolhouse ed. 1988).\r\n   It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues\r\nfeared that a campaign finance regulation such as \u00a7203\r\nmay be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore\r\nattended carefully to the choices the Legislature has\r\nmade. But the majority does not bother to consider such\r\npractical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply\r\nstipulates that \u201cenlightened self-government\u201d can arise\r\nonly in the absence of regulation. Ante, at 23. In light of\r\nthe distinctive features of corporations identified in Aus\r\ntin, there is no valid basis for this assumption. The mar\u00ad\r\nketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items\u2014or\r\nlaws\u2014are meant to be bought and sold, and when we\r\nmove from the realm of economics to the realm of corpo\u00ad\r\nrate electioneering, there may be no \u201creason to think the\r\nmarket ordering is intrinsically good at all,\u201d Strauss 1386.\r\n   The Court\u2019s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the\r\nFirst Amendment may well promote corporate power at\r\nthe cost of the individual and collective self-expression the\r\nAmendment was meant to serve. It will undoubtedly\r\ncripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the\r\nStates to adopt even limited measures to protect against\r\ncorporate domination of the electoral process. Americans\r\nmay be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  75 Under the majority\u2019s view, the legislature is thus damned if it does\r\nand damned if it doesn\u2019t. If the legislature gives media corporations an\r\nexemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corpora\u00ad\r\ntions, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against\r\nidentity-based distinctions. If the legislature does not give media\r\ncorporations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of\r\nthe press. The only way out of this invented bind: no regulations\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\f86    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nthe cause of self-government today.\r\n                   2. Shareholder Protection\r\n    There is yet another way in which laws such as \u00a7203 can\r\nserve First Amendment values. Interwoven with Austin\u2019s\r\nconcern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a\r\nconcern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of\r\ncoerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not\r\n\u201creflec[t] [their] support.\u201d 494 U. S., at 660\u2013661. When\r\ncorporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a\r\nparticular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the\r\nresidual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.\r\nThose shareholders who disagree with the corporation\u2019s\r\nelectoral message may find their financial investments\r\nbeing used to undermine their political convictions.\r\n    The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that\r\nthose who pay for an electioneering communication actu\u00ad\r\nally support its content and that managers do not use\r\ngeneral treasuries to advance personal agendas. Ibid. It\r\n\u201c \u2018allows corporate political participation without the temp\u00ad\r\ntation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite\r\npossibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders\r\nor members.\u2019 \u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204 (quoting\r\nBeaumont, 539 U. S., at 163). A rule that privileges the\r\nuse of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political\r\nspeech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent\r\nseeking behavior of executives and respects the views of\r\ndissenters. Austin\u2019s acceptance of restrictions on general\r\ntreasury spending \u201csimply allows people who have in\u00ad\r\nvested in the business corporation for purely economic\r\nreasons\u201d\u2014the vast majority of investors, one assumes\u2014\u201cto\r\navoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their\r\neconomic objectives.\u201d Winkler, Beyond Bellotti, 32 Loyola\r\n(LA) L. Rev. 133, 201 (1998).\r\n    The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and\r\nunion members has a long history in campaign finance\r\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

J., at 887\u2013900, and it has been endorsed in a long\r\nline of our cases, see, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204\u2013\r\n205; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 152\u2013154; MCFL, 479 U.

Indeed, we have unani\u00ad\r\nmously recognized the governmental interest in \u201cpro\u00ad\r\ntect[ing] the individuals who have paid money into a\r\ncorporation or union for purposes other than the support\r\nof candidates from having that money used to support\r\npolitical candidates to whom they may be opposed.\u201d\r\nNRWC, 459 U. S., at 207\u2013208.\r\n   The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that\r\nabuses of shareholder money can be corrected \u201cthrough\r\nthe procedures of corporate democracy,\u201d ante, at 46 (inter\u00ad\r\nnal quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through\r\nInternet-based disclosures, ante, at 55.76 I fail to under\u00ad\r\nstand how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union\r\nmembers, who will also be affected by today\u2019s ruling, and I\r\nfail to understand why the Court is so confident in these\r\nmechanisms. By \u201ccorporate democracy,\u201d presumably the\r\nCourt means the rights of shareholders to vote and to\r\nbring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In\r\npractice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you\r\nthat \u201cthese rights are so limited as to be almost nonexis\u00ad\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   76 I note that, among the many other regulatory possibilities it has\r\n\r\nleft open, ranging from new versions of \u00a7203 supported by additional\r\nevidence of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance to any number of\r\ntax incentive or public financing schemes, today\u2019s decision does not\r\nrequire that a legislature rely solely on these mechanisms to protect\r\nshareholders. Legislatures remain free in their incorporation and tax\r\nlaws to condition the types of activity in which corporations may\r\nengage, including electioneering activity, on specific disclosure re\u00ad\r\nquirements or on prior express approval by shareholders or members.\r\n\f88    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\ntent,\u201d given the internal authority wielded by boards and\r\nmanagers and the expansive protections afforded by the\r\nbusiness judgment rule. Blair & Stout 320; see also id., at\r\n298\u2013315; Winkler, 32 Loyola (LA) L. Rev., at 165\u2013166,\r\n199\u2013200. Modern technology may help make it easier to\r\ntrack corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but\r\nit is utopian to believe that it solves the problem. Most\r\nAmerican households that own stock do so through inter\u00ad\r\nmediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans, see\r\nEvans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. L. Rev.\r\n1105 (2009), which makes it more difficult both to monitor\r\nand to alter particular holdings. Studies show that a\r\nmajority of individual investors make no trades at all\r\nduring a given year. Id., at 1117. Moreover, if the corpo\u00ad\r\nration in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees\r\nthe company\u2019s ads may not know whether they are being\r\nfunded through the PAC or through the general treasury.\r\n   If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has\r\nbeen spending general treasury money on objectionable\r\nelectioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they\r\nreliably learn as much, however, this solution is only\r\npartial. The injury to the shareholders\u2019 expressive rights\r\nhas already occurred; they might have preferred to keep\r\nthat corporation\u2019s stock in their portfolio for any number\r\nof economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains\r\ntax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing\r\ntheir pension plan, or the like. The shareholder protection\r\nrationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that\r\ncorporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable\r\ncontributions in ways that any particular shareholder\r\nmight disapprove. But those expenditures do not impli\u00ad\r\ncate the selection of public officials, an area in which \u201cthe\r\ninterests of unwilling . . . corporate shareholders [in not\r\nbeing] forced to subsidize that speech\u201d \u201care at their ze\u00ad\r\nnith.\u201d Austin, 494 U. S., at 677 (Brennan, J., concurring).\r\nAnd in any event, the question is whether shareholder\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           89\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nprotection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in\r\nthe weeks before an election, not whether additional types\r\nof corporate communications might similarly be condi\u00ad\r\ntioned on voluntariness.\r\n   Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection\r\nrationale, the Austin Court did not hold it out as an ade\u00ad\r\nquate and independent ground for sustaining the statute\r\nin question. Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the\r\nantidistortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the\r\nproblem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if\r\nelectioneering expenditures can advance the political\r\nviews of some members of a corporation, they will often\r\ncompromise the views of others. See, e.g., id., at 663 (dis\u00ad\r\ncussing risk that corporation\u2019s \u201cmembers may be . . . reluc\u00ad\r\ntant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with\r\n[its] political expression\u201d). Second, it provides an addi\u00ad\r\ntional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the\r\ncorporate form, for doubting that these \u201cexpenditures\r\nreflect actual public support for the political ideas es\u00ad\r\npoused,\u201d id., at 660. The shareholder protection rationale,\r\nin other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on\r\ncorporate electioneering can serve both speakers\u2019 and\r\nlisteners\u2019 interests, as well as the anticorruption interest.\r\nAnd it supplies yet another reason why corporate expendi\u00ad\r\ntures merit less protection than individual expenditures.\r\n                              V\r\n   Today\u2019s decision is backwards in many senses. It ele\u00ad\r\nvates the majority\u2019s agenda over the litigants\u2019 submis\u00ad\r\nsions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitu\u00ad\r\ntional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual\r\ndissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion\r\nover tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over\r\nreality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nAustin must be overruled and that \u00a7203 is facially uncon\u00ad\r\nstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and\r\n\f90    CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\r\n\r\nrationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or\r\nignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the\r\nCourt\u2019s lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the\r\nsocietal interest in avoiding corruption and the appear\u00ad\r\nance of corruption does not provide an adequate justifica\u00ad\r\ntion for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate\r\nelections relies on an incorrect description of that interest,\r\nalong with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of estab\u00ad\r\nlished facts and the considered judgments of state and\r\nfederal legislatures over many decades.\r\n    In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on\r\nthe need to limit corporate campaign spending should\r\noutweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules. The\r\nmajority\u2019s rejection of this principle \u201celevate[s] corpora\u00ad\r\ntions to a level of deference which has not been seen at\r\nleast since the days when substantive due process was\r\nregularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought\r\nto unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.\u201d\r\nBellotti, 435 U. S., at 817, n. 13 (White, J., dissenting). At\r\nbottom, the Court\u2019s opinion is thus a rejection of the com\u00ad\r\nmon sense of the American people, who have recognized a\r\nneed to prevent corporations from undermining self\u00ad\r\ngovernment since the founding, and who have fought\r\nagainst the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate\r\nelectioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a\r\nstrange time to repudiate that common sense. While\r\nAmerican democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority\r\nof this Court would have thought its flaws included a\r\ndearth of corporate money in politics.\r\n   I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

By striking down \u00a7203,\r\nthe Court takes an important first step toward restoring\r\nfull constitutional protection to speech that is \u201cindispensa\u00ad\r\nble to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of\r\npopular government.\u201d McConnell v.

I dissent from\r\nPart IV of the Court\u2019s opinion, however, because the\r\nCourt\u2019s constitutional analysis does not go far enough.\r\nThe disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in\r\nBCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 are also unconstitutional.

In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court misap\u00ad\r\nprehends the import of \u201crecent events\u201d that some amici\r\n\f2      CITIZENS UNITED v.

The Court properly recognizes these events as\r\n\u201ccause for concern,\u201d ibid., but fails to acknowledge their\r\nconstitutional significance. In my view, amici\u2019s submis\u00ad\r\nsions show why the Court\u2019s insistence on upholding \u00a7\u00a7201\r\nand 311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated)\r\nas was its prior approval of \u00a7203.\r\n   Amici\u2019s examples relate principally to Proposition 8, a\r\nstate ballot proposition that California voters narrowly\r\npassed in the 2008 general election.         Proposition 8\r\namended California\u2019s constitution to provide that \u201c[o]nly\r\nmarriage between a man and a woman is valid or recog\u00ad\r\nnized in California.\u201d Cal. Const., Art. I, \u00a77.5. Any donor\r\nwho gave more than $100 to any committee supporting or\r\nopposing Proposition 8 was required to disclose his full\r\nname, street address, occupation, employer\u2019s name (or\r\nbusiness name, if self-employed), and the total amount of\r\nhis contributions.1 See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a784211(f)\r\n(West 2005). The California Secretary of State was then\r\nrequired to post this information on the Internet. See\r\n\u00a7\u00a784600\u201384601; \u00a7\u00a784602\u201384602.1 (West Supp. 2010);\r\n\u00a7\u00a784602.5\u201384604 (West 2005); \u00a785605 (West Supp. 2010);\r\n\u00a7\u00a784606\u201384609 (West 2005).\r\n   Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this informa\u00ad\r\ntion and created Web sites with maps showing the loca\u00ad\r\ntions of homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters.\r\nMany supporters (or their customers) suffered property\r\ndamage, or threats of physical violence or death, as a\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements.

They cited these incidents in a complaint they filed\r\nafter the 2008 election, seeking to invalidate California\u2019s\r\nmandatory disclosure laws. Supporters recounted being\r\ntold: \u201cConsider yourself lucky.

Two religious organizations supporting Proposi\u00ad\r\ntion 8 reportedly received through the mail envelopes\r\ncontaining a white powdery substance. Id., \u00b633.\r\n   Those accounts are consistent with media reports de\u00ad\r\nscribing Proposition 8-related retaliation. The director of\r\nthe nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to\r\nsupport the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists\r\ncomplained to his employer. Lott & Smith, Donor Disclo\u00ad\r\nsure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26,\r\n2008, p. A13. The director of the Los Angeles Film Festi\u00ad\r\nval was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because oppo\u00ad\r\nnents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival.\r\nIbid. And a woman who had managed her popular, fam\u00ad\r\nily-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign\r\nafter she gave $100, because \u201cthrongs of [angry] protest\u00ad\r\ners\u201d repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and \u201cshout[ed]\r\n\u2018shame on you\u2019 at customers.\u201d Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Up\u00ad\r\nends Her Life, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p.

Some sup\u00ad\r\nporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real\r\nestate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a\r\ngroup opposing Proposition 8 \u201creceived a letter from the\r\nProp. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his\r\ncompany\u2019s name if he didn\u2019t also donate to the \u2018Yes on 8\u2019\r\ncampaign.\u201d Donor Disclosure, supra, at A13.\r\n\f4     CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM\u2019N\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\r\n\r\n   The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently\r\nspawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed\r\ndonor information to pre-empt citizens\u2019 exercise of their\r\nFirst Amendment rights. Before the 2008 Presidential\r\nelection, a \u201cnewly formed nonprofit group . . . plann[ed] to\r\nconfront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a\r\nchilling effect that will dry up contributions.\u201d Luo, Group\r\nPlans Campaign Against G.O.P. Donors, N. Y. Times, Aug.\r\n8, 2008, p. A15. Its leader, \u201cwho described his effort as\r\n\u2018going for the jugular,\u2019 \u201d detailed the group\u2019s plan to send a\r\n\u201cwarning letter . . . alerting donors who might be consider\u00ad\r\ning giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential\r\ndangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and\r\nwatchdog groups digging through their lives.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate\r\nwhy this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure\r\nand reporting requirements. But amici present evidence\r\nof yet another reason to do so\u2014the threat of retaliation\r\nfrom elected officials. As amici\u2019s submissions make clear,\r\nthis threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition\r\nin California. For example, a candidate challenging an\r\nincumbent state attorney general reported that some\r\nmembers of the State\u2019s business community feared donat\u00ad\r\ning to his campaign because they did not want to cross the\r\nincumbent; in his words, \u201c \u2018I go to so many people and hear\r\nthe same thing: \u201cI sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but\r\nI can\u2019t afford to have my name on your records.

A11.\r\nThe incumbent won reelection in 2008.\r\n   My point is not to express any view on the merits of the\r\npolitical controversies I describe. Rather, it is to demon\u00ad\r\nstrate\u2014using real-world, recent examples\u2014the fallacy in\r\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[d]isclaimer and disclosure\r\nrequirements . . . impose no ceiling on campaign-related\r\nactivities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.\u201d\r\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

Disclaimer and disclosure re\u00ad\r\nquirements enable private citizens and elected officials to\r\nimplement political strategies specifically calculated to\r\ncurtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful,\r\npeaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.\r\n   The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied chal\u00ad\r\nlenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate\r\nthose speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can\r\n\u201cshow a reasonable probability that disclosure . . . will\r\nsubject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from\r\neither Government officials or private parties.\u201d Ante, at 52\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court\u2019s opin\u00ad\r\nion itself proves the irony in this compromise. In correctly\r\nexplaining why it must address the facial constitutionality\r\nof \u00a7203, see ante, at 5\u201320, the Court recognizes that \u201c[t]he\r\nFirst Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers\r\nto . . . seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most\r\nsalient political issues of our day,\u201d ante, at 7; that as\u00ad\r\napplied challenges to \u00a7203 \u201cwould require substantial\r\nlitigation over an extended time\u201d and result in an \u201cinter\u00ad\r\npretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable,\r\npervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech\r\npending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,\r\nwould themselves be questionable,\u201d ante, at 9\u201310; that \u201ca\r\ncourt would be remiss in performing its duties were it to\r\naccept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity\r\nof making a broader ruling,\u201d ante, at 12; and that avoiding\r\na facial challenge to \u00a7203 \u201cwould prolong the substantial,\r\nnation-wide chilling effect\u201d that \u00a7203 causes, ante, at 16.\r\nThis logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied chal\u00ad\r\nlenges to \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.\r\n   Irony aside, the Court\u2019s promise that as-applied chal\u00ad\r\nlenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assur\u00ad\r\nance. Now more than ever, \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 will chill pro\u00ad\r\ntected speech because\u2014as California voters can attest\u2014\r\n\f6      CITIZENS UNITED v.

Two of his court-appointed attorneys,\n Dozier and Ralph, had significant trial experience, but the third,\n Trotter, had only recently been admitted to the bar. After exhausting\n his appeals, Wood sought postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of\n Criminal Procedure 32, arguing, among other things, that he was\n mentally retarded and not eligible for the death penalty, and that his\n trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to investigate and\n present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the trial\u2019s penalty\n phase. The Rule 32 court conducted evidentiary hearings and denied\n the claims initially and on remand. As to the mental retardation\n claim, it found that Wood had not shown deficits in his adaptive func\n tioning. As to the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it concluded\n that he had not established that his counsel\u2019s performance was defi\n cient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense. In so doing, it\n made a factual finding that counsel had made a strategic decision not\n to pursue evidence of Wood\u2019s alleged retardation.

It also found no reason\n    able probability of a different outcome had the evidence developed in\n    the Rule 32 proceedings been presented at trial. Woods subsequently\n    sought federal habeas relief under \u00a72254. The District Court rejected\n    all but his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The District Court\n    concluded that the state court\u2019s finding that counsel made a strategic\n    decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts. The court\n    further held that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and had preju\n    diced Wood, and that the state court\u2019s contrary holdings were an un\n    reasonable application of federal law under Strickland v.

Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that the\n    state court\u2019s rejection of Wood\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim was nei\n    ther an unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based\n    on an unreasonable determination of the facts. With respect to the\n    facts, it concluded that the evidence in the Rule 32 hearings sup\n    ported the state court\u2019s strategic-decision finding, and it agreed with\n    the state court\u2019s legal conclusion that counsel\u2019s strategic decision was\n    reasonable and that Wood had failed to show prejudice. Wood\u2019s cer\n    tiorari petition raises the questions (1) whether, in order to obtain re\n    lief under \u00a72254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish only that the state\n    court factual determination on which the decision was based was\n    \u201cunreasonable,\u201d or whether \u00a72254(e)(1) additionally requires a peti\n    tioner to rebut a presumption that the determination was correct\n    with clear and convincing evidence; and (2) whether the state court\u2019s\n    strategic-decision determination was reasonable.\nHeld:\n    1. Even under Wood\u2019s reading of \u00a72254(d)(2), the state court\u2019s con\n clusion that his counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or\n present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable\n determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n state-court proceedings. This Court need not reach the question\n whether \u00a72254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge un\n der \u00a72254(d)(2), see Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 339, because its\n view of the state court\u2019s factual determination here does not depend\n on an interpretative difference regarding the relationship between\n those provisions. While \u201c[t]he term \u2018unreasonable\u2019 is . . . difficult to\n define,\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410, it suffices to say that\n a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely be\n cause the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclu\n sion in the first instance. See Rice, supra, at 341\u2013342. Here, the\n state-court record shows that all of Wood\u2019s counsel read the Kirkland\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the re\n  port merited further investigation, a recollection supported by the at\n  torneys\u2019 contemporaneous letters; and Trotter told the sentencing\n  judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the report to the jury.\n  This evidence can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 court\u2019s factual\n  determination that counsel\u2019s failure to pursue or present evidence of\n  Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but the\n  result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses. Most of the\n  contrary evidence Wood highlights\u2014e.g., that Dozier and Ralph put\n  the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase proceed\n  ings\u2014speaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but to\n  whether counsel\u2019s judgment was reasonable, a question not before\n  this Court.

RICHARD F. ALLEN,\n\n  COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF \n\n            CORRECTIONS, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 20, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 contains two provisions governing federal-court\nreview of state-court factual findings. Under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2), a federal court may not grant a state pris\noner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus based on a\nclaim already adjudicated on the merits in state court\nunless that adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court proceed\ning.\u201d Under \u00a72254(e)(1), \u201ca determination of a factual\nissue made by a State court shall be presumed to be cor\nrect,\u201d and the petitioner \u201cshall have the burden of rebut\nting the presumption of correctness by clear and convinc\ning evidence.\u201d In this case, petitioner, a capital defendant,\nchallenges the key factual finding made by the Alabama\nstate court that denied his application for postconviction\nrelief: that his attorneys\u2019 failure to pursue and present\nmitigating evidence of his borderline mental retardation\nwas a strategic decision rather than a negligent omission.\n\f2                     WOOD v. ALLEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner argues that the state court\u2019s finding was unrea\nsonable under \u00a72254(d)(2) and that, in denying his federal\nhabeas petition, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit erroneously conflated this standard with that of\n\u00a72254(e)(1), which petitioner contends is not applicable in\ncases, such as this one, not involving a separate federal\nhabeas evidentiary hearing.\n  We granted certiorari to address the relationship be\ntween \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(2) and (e)(1). We conclude, however, that\nthe state court\u2019s factual determination was reasonable\neven under petitioner\u2019s reading of \u00a72254(d)(2), and there\nfore we need not address that provision\u2019s relationship to\n\u00a72254(e)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals on that basis.\n                             I\n   In 1993, petitioner Holly Wood broke into the home of\nhis ex-girlfriend and shot her in the head and face as she\nlay in her bed. The victim was pronounced dead on arrival\nat the hospital. Charged with capital murder during a\nfirst-degree burglary, Wood was represented at trial in\nAlabama state court by three court-appointed attorneys:\nCary Dozier and Frank Ralph, both of whom had signifi\ncant trial experience, and Kenneth Trotter, who had been\nadmitted to the bar for five months at the time he was\nappointed. The jury convicted Wood at the guilt phase of\ntrial and recommended a death sentence at the penalty\nphase by a vote of 10 to 2. After a separate sentencing\nhearing, the trial judge imposed the death penalty. The\nAlabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Wood\u2019s\nconviction and sentence, Ex parte Wood, 715 So. 2d 812\n(1996), as did the Alabama Supreme Court, Wood v. State,\n715 So. 2d 819 (1998). This Court denied certiorari. Wood\nv. Alabama, 525 U. S. 1042 (1998).\n   Wood petitioned for state postconviction relief under\nAlabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2009), arguing,\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namong other things, that he was mentally retarded and\nnot eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial coun\nsel were ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU. S. 668 (1984), because they failed to investigate and\npresent evidence of his mental deficiencies during the\npenalty phase of trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a\u2013202a,\n207a\u2013210a, 213a\u2013216a, 220a\u2013221a, 225a. The Rule 32\ncourt held two evidentiary hearings and denied Wood\u2019s\nclaims. On appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Ap\npeals remanded for further consideration in light of Atkins\nv. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), which held that the\nEighth Amendment prohibits the execution of the men\ntally retarded. Wood v. State, 891 So. 2d 398 (2003).\n   On remand, the Rule 32 court conducted a third eviden\ntiary hearing and once again denied relief. As to Wood\u2019s\nclaim of mental retardation, the court found that, while\nthe evidence suggested that he \u201cprobably does exhibit\nsignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,\u201d\nhe had failed to show \u201cthat he has significant or substan\ntial deficits in his adaptive functioning.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 236a\u2013237a.\n   The court also rejected Wood\u2019s factually related claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel, concluding that Wood\nhad failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense. Id.,\nat 257a\u2013275a. The court first made a factual finding that\nWood\u2019s counsel had made a strategic decision not to pur\nsue evidence of his alleged mental retardation. The court\nobserved that counsel had requested that a Dr. Karl Kirk\nland conduct a mental evaluation, had \u201cthoroughly re\nviewed Dr. Kirkland\u2019s report,\u201d and had \u201cdetermined that\nnothing in that report merited further investigation.\u201d Id.,\nat 264a, 271a. The court additionally found that counsel\nappeared to have made a strategic decision not to present\nto the jury the limited evidence of Wood\u2019s mental deficien\ncies in their possession, because \u201ccalling Dr. Kirkland to\n\f4                     WOOD v. ALLEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntestify was not in Wood\u2019s best interest.\u201d Id., at 271a\u2013272a.\nThe court concluded that these strategic decisions were\nreasonable and thus that counsel had not performed defi\nciently. Ibid. The court further concluded that there was\n\u201cno reasonable probability\u201d of a different outcome had the\nevidence developed in the Rule 32 hearings been presented\nto the jury or to the sentencing court. Id., at 273a. The\nAlabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, App. 589\u2013\n610, and the Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari,\nid., at 4.\n    Wood then filed a petition for federal habeas relief\nunder \u00a72254. The District Court rejected all of Wood\u2019s\nclaims save one: that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and\npresent mitigation evidence of his mental deficiencies\nduring the penalty phase constituted ineffective assistance\nof counsel. 465 F. Supp. 2d 1211, 1239\u20131245 (MD Ala.\n2006). According to the court, there was \u201cnothing in the\nrecord to even remotely support a finding that counsel\nmade a strategic decision not to let the jury at the penalty\nstage know about Wood\u2019s mental condition.\u201d Id., at 1242.\nRalph and Dozier, the court noted, had placed the inexpe\nrienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase. At the\nRule 32 hearing, Trotter testified that he had seen the\nreferences to Wood\u2019s intellectual functioning in the Kirk\nland report but did not recall considering whether to\npursue that issue. Trotter further testified that he had\nunsuccessfully attempted to subpoena Wood\u2019s school re\ncords and that he did not recall speaking to any of Wood\u2019s\nteachers. Trotter had also written to an attorney at the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center explaining that he was\n\u201c \u2018stressed out over this case and [didn\u2019t] have anyone with\nwhom to discuss the case, including the other two attor\nneys.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1241. Shortly before the penalty phase\nbegan, Trotter told the judge that he would request fur\nther psychological evaluation before the judge\u2019s sentencing\nhearing, even though the evaluation would come too late\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto be considered by the jury. Id., at 1241\u20131242. Based on\nthis evidence, the District Court concluded that the state\ncourt\u2019s finding \u201cthat a strategic decision was made not to\ninvestigate or introduce to the sentencing jury evidence of\nmental retardation [was] an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the clear and convincing evidence\npresented in the record.\u201d Ibid.\n   Having rejected the state court\u2019s factual determinations,\nthe District Court held that counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance preju\ndiced Wood, concluding that the state court\u2019s holdings to\nthe contrary constituted \u201can unreasonable application of\nfederal law under Strickland.\u201d Id., at 1245. The court\ngranted the petition on this claim and ordered the State\neither to resentence Wood to life without parole or to\nconduct a new sentencing hearing.\n   In a divided opinion, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the\ngrant of habeas relief. 542 F. 3d 1281 (2008). The major\nity began by explaining the standard of review: \u201cSection\n2254(d) permits federal habeas relief only where the state\ncourts\u2019 decisions were (1) \u2018contrary to, or involved an un\nreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u2019\nor (2) \u2018based on an unreasonable determination of the facts\nin light of the evidence presented in the State court pro\nceeding.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1285 (quoting \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(2)). A \u201c \u2018de\ntermination of a factual issue made by a State court shall\nbe presumed to be correct,\u2019 \u201d the majority explained, and\nthe petitioner \u201c \u2018shall have the burden of rebutting the\npresumption of correctness by clear and convincing evi\ndence.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting \u00a72254(e)(1)). \u201cThus,\u201d the majority\nstated, the federal habeas court\u2019s \u201c \u2018review of findings of\nfact by the state court is even more deferential than under\na clearly erroneous standard of review.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   The majority then held that the Alabama court\u2019s rejec\ntion of Wood\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was\n\f6                     WOOD v. ALLEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneither an unreasonable application of clearly established\nlaw nor based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts. With respect to the facts, the court concluded that\nthe evidence presented in the Rule 32 hearings supported\nthe state court\u2019s findings that counsel made a strategic\ndecision not to present mental health evidence during the\npenalty phase. \u201cAt a minimum,\u201d the court noted, \u201cWood\nhas not presented evidence, much less clear and convinc\ning evidence, that counsel did not make such decisions.\u201d\nId., at 1304, n. 23. The court also agreed with the state\ncourt\u2019s legal conclusion that counsel\u2019s strategic decision\nwas reasonable. According to the court, the silent record\ncreated a presumption that counsel exercised sound pro\nfessional judgment, supported by ample reasons, not to\npresent the information they had obtained. These reasons\nincluded unfavorable information in Dr. Kirkland\u2019s report,\nsuch as details about Wood\u2019s 19 earlier arrests and his\nprevious attempt to murder another ex-girlfriend, as well\nas Dr. Kirkland\u2019s conclusion that, notwithstanding Wood\u2019s\nmental deficiencies, Wood had a high level of adaptive\nfunctioning. Id., at 1304\u20131306. The court added that the\ninvestigation preceding counsel\u2019s decision was sufficient to\npermit them to make a reasoned decision, crediting the\nRule 32 court\u2019s findings that, inter alia, counsel not only\nemployed an investigator who sought mitigation evidence\nfrom family members but also themselves met with family\nmembers and sought guidance from capital defense or\nganizations. Id., at 1307\u20131308. The court also accepted as\nnot \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d the state court\u2019s determina\ntion that Wood had failed to show prejudice from counsel\u2019s\nfailure to present evidence of his mental deficiencies. Id.,\nat 1309, 1314.\n   The dissent, implicitly considering the factual question\nwhether counsel made a strategic decision as part and\nparcel of the legal question whether any strategic decision\nwas reasonable, concluded that \u201c[n]o such strategic deci\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsions could possibly have been made in this case because\ncounsel had failed to adequately investigate the available\nmitigating evidence.\u201d Id., at 1316. According to the dis\nsent, \u201cthe weight of the evidence in the record demon\nstrates that Trotter, an inexperienced and overwhelmed\nattorney,\u201d unassisted by senior counsel, \u201crealized too\nlate\u201d\u2014only in time to present it to the sentencing judge,\nnot to the penalty jury\u2014\u201cwhat any reasonably prepared\nattorney would have known: that evidence of Wood\u2019s men\ntal impairments could have served as mitigating evidence\nand deserved investigation so that it could properly be\npresented before sentencing.\u201d Id., at 1320. The dissent\nalso concluded that there was a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome at the penalty phase had the evidence\nbeen presented, because the jury could have concluded\nthat Wood was less culpable as a result of his diminished\nabilities. Id., at 1322\u20131325. The dissent therefore con\ncluded that the state court\u2019s application of Strickland to\nthe facts of this case was unreasonable. 542 F. 3d, at\n1326.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve two related questions\nraised by Wood\u2019s petition. First, we granted review of a\nquestion that has divided the Courts of Appeals: whether,\nin order to satisfy \u00a72254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish\nonly that the state-court factual determination on which\nthe decision was based was \u201cunreasonable,\u201d or whether\n\u00a72254(e)(1) additionally requires a petitioner to rebut a\npresumption that the determination was correct with clear\nand convincing evidence.1 We also granted review of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1See, e.g., 542 F. 3d 1281, 1285, 1304, n. 23 (CA11 2008) (decision\n\nbelow); Taylor v.

For present pur\nposes, we assume for the sake of argument that the factual\ndetermination at issue should be reviewed, as Wood urges,\nonly under \u00a72254(d)(2) and not under \u00a72254(e)(1). We\nconclude that, under \u00a72254(d)(2), the state court\u2019s finding\nthat Wood\u2019s counsel made a strategic decision not to pur\nsue or present evidence of Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies was\nnot an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\nthe evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. We\ntherefore do not need to decide whether that determina\ntion should be reviewed under the arguably more deferen\ntial standard set out in \u00a72254(e)(1).\n   As we have observed in related contexts, \u201c[t]he term\n\u2018unreasonable\u2019 is no doubt difficult to define.\u201d Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410 (2000). It suffices to say, how\never, that a state-court factual determination is not un\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In Wood\u2019s view, when a petitioner seeks relief based entirely on the\nstate-court record, a federal court reviews the state court\u2019s findings for\nreasonableness under \u00a72254(d)(2). Section 2254(e)(1) comes into play,\naccording to Wood, only when a petitioner challenges individual state\ncourt factual findings based in part on evidence that is extrinsic to the\nstate-court record. Brief for Petitioner 38\u201339. According to respon\ndents, \u00a72254(e)(1) applies to any challenge to a state court\u2019s factual\nfindings under \u00a72254(d)(2), including a challenge based solely on the\nstate-court record. Brief for Respondents 35\u201337. Respondents\u2019 amici\noffer still further variations, although they all agree with respondents\nthat \u00a72254(e)(1) applies in some fashion in every habeas case reviewing\nstate-court factual findings.

ALLEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would\nhave reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\nCf. id., at 411. In Rice, for example, in which we assumed,\narguendo, that only \u00a72254(d)(2) and not \u00a72254(e)(1) ap\nplied, 546 U. S., at 339, we rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nconclusion that a state-court factual determination was\nunreasonable. We noted that even if \u201c[r]easonable minds\nreviewing the record might disagree\u201d about the finding in\nquestion, \u201con habeas review that does not suffice to super\nsede the trial court\u2019s . . . determination.\u201d Id., at 341\u2013342.\n  In this case, the evidence in the state-court record dem\nonstrated that all of Wood\u2019s counsel read the Kirkland\nreport. App. 12, 174, 210, 283. Trotter testified that\nDozier told him that nothing in the report merited further\ninvestigation, a recollection that is supported by contem\nporaneous letters Trotter wrote to Dozier and Ralph not\ning that no independent psychological evaluations had\nbeen conducted because Dozier had said they would not be\nneeded. Id., at 283, 343, 345. Trotter also told the sen\ntencing judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the\nKirkland report to the jury. Id., at 12. This evidence in\nthe state-court record can fairly be read to support the\nRule 32 court\u2019s factual determination that counsel\u2019s failure\nto pursue or present evidence of Wood\u2019s mental deficien\ncies was not mere oversight or neglect but was instead the\nresult of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses.\n  Arguing that the state court\u2019s factual determination to\nthis effect was unreasonable, Wood calls our attention to\nDozier\u2019s testimony during the Rule 32 proceedings that\nevidence of Wood\u2019s mental health problems would have\nbeen presented during the penalty phase if counsel had\nbeen aware of it, id., at 169; that Dozier did not recall\nwhether he had decided not to present evidence based on\nthe Kirkland report, id., at 168, 171; and that Dozier and\nRalph had designated the inexperienced Trotter to be in\ncharge of the penalty phase proceedings, id., at 270\u2013271.\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

Wood also ob\nserves that the Kirkland report was prepared for the guilt\nphase, not the penalty phase, and a strategic decision not\nto use the Kirkland report in the former does not necessar\nily carry over into the latter. Id., at 324. Wood notes that\nhis counsel sought to obtain additional evidence about his\nmental health to use in mitigation after reviewing the\nKirkland report, but they failed to pursue it, in part out of\na belief that the sentencing judge would not grant a con\ntinuance to permit them to investigate. Id., at 285, 343\u2013\n346. Finally, Wood emphasizes that his counsel must\nhave thought that evidence of his mental deficiencies was\nimportant because they presented it to the judge at the\nfinal sentencing hearing. Id., at 88.\n   Most of the evidence Wood highlights, however, speaks\nnot to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but\nrather to whether counsel\u2019s judgment was reasonable\u2014a\nquestion we do not reach. See Part II\u2013B, infra. As for any\nevidence that may plausibly be read as inconsistent with\nthe finding that counsel made a strategic decision, we\nconclude that it does not suffice to demonstrate that the\nfinding was unreasonable.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent suggests that counsel could not have made a strategic\ndecision not to pursue evidence of Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies because\nthere could be no reasonable justification for doing so. Post, at 3\u20135\n(opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by KENNEDY, J.). This interpretation\nconflates the question whether a decision was strategic with the ques\ntion whether a strategic decision was reasonable. Cf. post, at 2, n. 1.\nWithout expressing a view on the ultimate reasonableness of the\ndecision not to pursue this evidence further, we note that the Eleventh\nCircuit majority observed that the state court could reasonably have\ndetermined that counsel had strategic grounds for their decision. In\nparticular, evidence about Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies may have led to\nrebuttal testimony about the capabilities he demonstrated through his\nextensive criminal history, an extraordinarily limited amount of which\nwas actually admitted at the penalty phase of the trial. Counsel\u2019s\n\f12                         WOOD v. ALLEN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Reviewing all of the evidence, we agree with the State\nthat even if it is debatable, it is not unreasonable to con\nclude that, after reviewing the Kirkland report, counsel\nmade a strategic decision not to inquire further into the\ninformation contained in the report about Wood\u2019s mental\ndeficiencies and not to present to the jury such informa\ntion as counsel already possessed about these deficiencies.\nCf. Rice, supra, at 341\u2013342. For that reason, we agree\nwith the Court of Appeals that the District Court erred in\nholding to the contrary.\n                             B\n  Wood also argues that the state-court decision involved\nan unreasonable application of Strickland under\n\u00a72254(d)(1) because counsel failed to make a reasonable\ninvestigation of Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies before deciding\nnot to pursue or present such evidence. Without a reason\nable investigation, Wood contends, these decisions were an\nunreasonable exercise of professional judgment and con\nstituted deficient performance under Strickland. We\nagree with the State, however, that this argument is not\n\u201cfairly included\u201d in the questions presented under this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 14.1(a). Whether the state court reasonably\ndetermined that there was a strategic decision under\n\u00a72254(d)(2) is a different question from whether the stra\ntegic decision itself was a reasonable exercise of profes\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndecision successfully thwarted the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to admit evidence\nthat Wood murdered his ex-girlfriend while on parole for an attempted\nmurder of a different ex-girlfriend that was strikingly similar in execu\ntion to the subsequent successful murder. App. 23\u201324. Moreover, as\nthe Eleventh Circuit majority noted, evidence of Wood\u2019s mental defi\nciencies also could have undercut the defense\u2019s argument that he left\nschool to support his family, suggesting instead that he left school\nbecause of educational difficulties. 542 F. 3d, at 1305\u20131306.

Wood\u2019s experienced counsel\nmade a perfectly sensible decision not to introduce Dr.\nKirkland\u2019s report into evidence or to call him as a witness.\nThat was a strategic decision based on their judgment that\nthe evidence would do more harm than good. But it does\nnot follow from this single strategic decision that counsel\nalso made a strategic decision to forgo investigating pow\nerful mitigating evidence of Wood\u2019s mental deficits for the\npenalty phase. On the contrary, the only reasonable\nfactual conclusion I can draw from this record is that\ncounsel\u2019s decision to do so was the result of inattention\nand neglect. Because such a decision is the antithesis of a\n\u201cstrategic\u201d choice, I would reverse the decision of the Court\nof Appeals.\n   Assuming that the Court is correct to decline to consider\nwhether the state court\u2019s application of Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984) was reasonable, see\nante, at 12\u201313, the question whether the decision itself\nwas the product of a strategy is still before us. The Court\n\f2                           WOOD v. ALLEN\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmay well be correct that the state court reasonably con\ncluded that counsel made a decision not to pursue Dr.\nKirkland\u2019s report for either guilt or penalty phase pur\nposes, ante, at 10\u201312, but to reject Wood\u2019s claim the state\ncourt also had to reasonably conclude that such a decision\nwas borne of strategy. And whether counsel\u2019s decision was\nthe product of strategy is a question of fact for purposes of\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2).1 Cf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.\n510, 526\u2013527 (2003) (observing that \u201cthe \u2018strategic deci\nsion\u2019 the state courts and respondents all invoke to justify\ncounsel\u2019s limited pursuit of mitigating evidence resembles\nmore a post hoc rationalization of counsel\u2019s conduct than\nan accurate description of their deliberations prior to\nsentencing\u201d); Carr v. Schofield, 364 F. 3d 1246, 1264\n(CA11 2004) (identifying \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s decisions were\ntactical or strategic\u201d as a question of fact (citing Horton v.\nZant, 941 F. 2d 1449, 1462 (CA11 1991)));2 Berryman v.\nMorton, 100 F. 3d 1089, 1095 (CA3 1996) (same). In other\nwords, the Court correctly concludes that the record rea\nsonably supports a finding that counsel decided not to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 TheCourt explains: \u201cWhether the state court reasonably determined\nthat there was a strategic decision under \u00a72254(d)(2) is a different\nquestion from whether the strategic decision itself was a reasonable\nexercise of professional judgment under Strickland or whether the\napplication of Strickland was reasonable under \u00a72254(d)(1).\u201d Ante, at\n12\u201313. I agree with the majority that whether a particular strategic\ndecision is reasonable or not is the Strickland question we would\naddress were we reviewing Wood\u2019s claim for habeas relief under\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   2 Indeed, the law in the Eleventh Circuit on this point is well settled:\n\n\u201c \u2018The question of whether an attorney\u2019s actions were actually the\nproduct of a tactical or strategic decision is an issue of fact . . . . \u2019 \u201d\nFotopoulos v.

The answer to this question\nis unequivocally no.\n   Before petitioner\u2019s trial, his counsel learned that Wood\nhad an \u201cIQ in the borderline range of intellectual function\ning,\u201d App. 327, and was \u201cfunctioning, at most,\u201d in this\nborderline range, id., at 328. Wood was \u201creading on less\nthan a 3rd grade level.\u201d Id., at 327. His former special\neducation teacher testified during postconviction review\nthat Wood was classified as \u201ceducable mentally retarded\u201d\nby the local school system. Id., at 403. In short, Wood has\nthe type of significant mental deficits that we recognize as\n\u201cinherently mitigating,\u201d Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U. S. 274,\n287 (2004).3\n   Despite the powerful mitigating value of this evidence,\n\u201c[n]o evidence of Wood\u2019s mental retardation was ever\npresented to the jury.\u201d 542 F. 3d 1281, 1314 (CA11 2008)\n(Barkett, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Coun\nsel was clearly aware that this evidence existed, id., at\n1318, but chose not to investigate it beyond the conclu\nsions outlined in Dr. Kirkland\u2019s report, App. 283. In the\nCourt\u2019s view, the record reasonably supports the state\ncourt\u2019s conclusion that \u201ccounsel made a strategic decision\nnot to inquire further into\u201d Wood\u2019s mental deficiencies,\nante, at 12. Although I agree with the majority that the\nfailure was the result of a \u201cdecision,\u201d albeit a hasty one,\nthe Court regrettably fails to consider whether the deci\nsion was also \u201cstrategic\u201d as a matter of fact.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Although Wood does not fall within the class of individuals we iden\n\ntified in Atkins v.

ALLEN\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   A decision cannot be fairly characterized as \u201cstrategic\u201d\nunless it is a conscious choice between two legitimate and\nrational alternatives. It must be borne of deliberation and\nnot happenstance, inattention, or neglect. See Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 526 (concluding that counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to\ninvestigate thoroughly resulted from inattention, not\nreasoned strategic judgment\u201d); Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690\u2013691. Moreover, \u201ca cursory investigation\u201d does not\n\u201cautomatically justif[y] a tactical decision with respect to\nsentencing strategy.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Al\nthough we afford deference to counsel\u2019s strategic decisions,\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 690\u2013691, for this deference to\napply there must be some evidence that the decision was\njust that: strategic.\n   The lawyers\u2019 duty to conduct a thorough investigation of\npossible mitigating evidence is well established by our\ncases, Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374,\n387 (2005); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 522\u2013523; Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000); Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n688. These cases also make clear that counsel\u2019s unconsid\nered decision to fail to discharge that duty cannot be stra\ntegic. The only conceivable strategy that might support\nforgoing counsel\u2019s ethical obligations under these circum\nstances would be a reasoned conclusion that further inves\ntigation is futile and thus a waste of valuable time. Cf. id.,\nat 691 (recognizing that counsel\u2019s decision to abandon an\ninvestigation is entitled to deference \u201cwhen a defendant\nhas given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain\ninvestigations would be fruitless or even harmful\u201d). There\nis no evidence in the record to suggest that Wood\u2019s counsel\nreached such a conclusion.4 See 542 F. 3d, at 1321\u20131322\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Court conflates the strategic decision to present mitigating\n\nevidence to the jury with the strategic decision to investigate avenues\nof mitigating evidence fully, see ante, at 11\u201312, n. 3. My concern is that\n\f                      Cite as: 558 U.

On\nthe contrary, the Court recognizes that Wood has pointed\nto substantial evidence that Trotter, the attorney who had\nprimary responsibility for Wood\u2019s penalty phase, believed\nthat further investigation had value, ante, at 10\u201311.\nDespite the fact that Trotter had a meager five months of\nexperience as a lawyer when he was appointed to repre\nsent Wood, App. 261, even he knew that further investi-\ngation into any mental or psychological deficits was in\norder.5\n   In my view, any decision to abandon an investigation\ninto the mitigating evidence signaled by Dr. Kirkland\u2019s\nreport was so obviously unreasonable that the decision\nitself is highly persuasive evidence that counsel did not\nhave any strategy in mind when they did so. I share the\nview of my dissenting colleague below that the District\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthere is no evidence to support a conclusion that there was a strategic\ndecision on the latter, which is a necessary prerequisite for counsel to\nmake reasoned choices with respect to what evidence should go before\nthe jury during the penalty phase of a capital trial. See, e.g., Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 522 (explaining that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to uncover and\npresent voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be\njustified as a tactical decision to focus on [defendant\u2019s] voluntary\nconfessions, because counsel had not \u2018fulfill[ed] their obligation to\nconduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting Williams, 529 U.

NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n\n No. 138, Orig. Argued October 13, 2009\u2014Decided January 20, 2010\nSouth Carolina brought this original action seeking an equitable appor\n  tionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River\u2019s (river) waters.\n  The Court referred the matter to a Special Master, together with the\n  motions of three nonstate entities\u2014the Catawba River Water Supply\n  Project (CRWSP), Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy), and\n  the city of Charlotte, N. C.\u2014seeking leave to intervene as parties.\n  South Carolina opposed the motions. After a hearing, the Special\n  Master granted all three motions and, on South Carolina\u2019s request,\n  memorialized her reasoning in a First Interim Report. Among other\n  things, she recognized that New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369,\n  373, sets forth the \u201cappropriate\u201d standard for a nonstate entity\u2019s in\n  tervention in an original action; looked beyond intervention to origi\n  nal actions in which the Court allowed complaining States to name\n  nonstate entities as defendants in order to give that standard con\n  text; \u201cdistilled\u201d from the cases a broad rule governing intervention;\n  and applied that rule to each of the proposed intervenors. South\n  Carolina presented exceptions.\nHeld: The CRWSP and Duke Energy have satisfied the appropriate\n intervention standard, but Charlotte has not. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) Under New Jersey v. New York, \u201c[a]n intervenor whose state is\n already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling\n interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all\n other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not prop\n erly represented by the state.\u201d 345 U. S., at 373. That standard ap\n plies equally well in this case. Although high, the standard is not in\n surmountable. See, e.g., Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 581. The\n Court declines to adopt the Special Master\u2019s proposed intervention\n rule, under which nonstate entities may become parties to original\n disputes in appropriate and compelling circumstances, such as\n\f2               SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    where, e.g., the nonstate entity is the instrumentality authorized to\n    carry out the wrongful conduct or injury for which the complaining\n    State seeks relief. A compelling reason for allowing citizens to par\n    ticipate in one original action is not necessarily a compelling reason\n    for allowing them to intervene in all original actions. Pp. 6\u201311.\n       (b) This Court applies the New Jersey v. New York standard to the\n    proposed intervenors. Pp. 11\u201318.\n         (1) The CRWSP should be allowed to intervene. It is an unusual\n    bistate entity that is jointly owned and regulated by, and supplies\n    water from the river to, North Carolina\u2019s Union County and South\n    Carolina\u2019s Lancaster County. It has shown a compelling interest in\n    protecting the viability of its operations, which are premised on a fine\n    balance between the joint venture\u2019s two participating counties. The\n    stresses this litigation would place on the CRWSP threaten to upset\n    that balance. Moreover, neither State has sufficient interest in main\n    taining that balance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP\u2019s inter\n    ests. The complaint attributes a portion of the total water transfers\n    alleged to have harmed South Carolina to the CRWSP, but North\n    Carolina cannot represent the joint venture\u2019s interests, since it will\n    likely respond to the complaint\u2019s demand for a greater share of the\n    river\u2019s water by taking the position that downstream users\u2014such as\n    Lancaster County\u2014should receive less water. See, e.g., Colorado v.\n    New Mexico, 459 U. S. 176, 186\u2013187. Any disruption to the CRWSP\u2019s\n    operations would increase\u2014not lessen\u2014the difficulty of achieving a\n    \u201cjust and equitable\u201d allocation in this dispute. See Nebraska v. Wyo\n    ming, 325 U. S. 589, 618. Pp. 11\u201314.\n         (2) Duke Energy should also be permitted to intervene. It has\n    carried its burden of showing unique and compelling interests: It op\n    erates 11 dams and reservoirs in both States that generate electricity\n    for the region and control the river\u2019s flow; holds a 50-year federal li\n    cense governing its hydroelectric power operations; and is the entity\n    that orchestrated a multistakeholder negotiation process culminating\n    in a Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement (CRA), signed by 70 enti\n    ties from both States, which sets the terms under which Duke Energy\n    has applied to renew its license. These interests will be relevant to\n    the Court\u2019s ultimate decision, since it is likely that any equitable ap\n    portionment of the river will need to take into account the amount of\n    water that Duke Energy needs to sustain its operations. And, there\n    is no other similarly situated entity on the river, setting Duke\u2019s in\n    terests apart from the class of all other citizens of the States. Just as\n    important, Duke Energy has a unique and compelling interest in pro\n    tecting the terms of its license and as the entity that orchestrated the\n    CRA, which represents a consensus regarding the appropriate mini\n    mum continuous flow of river water into South Carolina under a va\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Moreover, neither State is situated to properly rep\n  resent Duke Energy\u2019s compelling interests. Neither has signed the\n  CRA or expressed an intention to defend its terms, and, in fact, North\n  Carolina intends to seek its modification. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (3) However, because Charlotte\u2019s interest is not sufficiently\n  unique and will be properly represented by North Carolina, the city\u2019s\n  intervention is not required. Charlotte is a North Carolina munici\n  pality, and for purposes of this litigation, its water transfers from the\n  river basin constitute part of that State\u2019s equitable share. While the\n  complaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North Caro\n  lina to carry out a large water transfer from the river basin, the com\n  plaint does not seek relief against Charlotte directly, but, rather,\n  seeks relief against all North Carolina-authorized water transfers in\n  excess of that State\u2019s equitable share. Charlotte, therefore, occupies\n  a class of affected North Carolina water users, and the magnitude of\n  its authorized transfer does not distinguish it in kind from other class\n  members. Nor does Charlotte represent interstate interests that fall\n  on both sides of this dispute, as does the CRWSP. Pp. 16\u201318.\nExceptions to Special Master\u2019s First Interim Report overruled in part\n  and sustained in part.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,\nSCALIA, KENNEDY, and BREYER, JJ., joined.

STATE \n\n             OF NORTH CAROLINA \n\n ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                              [January 20, 2010]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The State of South Carolina brought this original action\nagainst the State of North Carolina, seeking an equitable\napportionment of the Catawba River. We appointed a\nSpecial Master and referred the matter to her, together\nwith the motions of three nonstate entities seeking to\nintervene in the dispute as parties. South Carolina op\u00ad\nposed the motions. After holding a hearing, the Special\nMaster granted the motions and, upon South Carolina\u2019s\nrequest, memorialized the reasons for her decision in a\nFirst Interim Report. South Carolina then presented\nexceptions, and we set the matter for argument.\n   Two of the three proposed intervenors have satisfied the\nstandard for intervention in original actions that we ar\u00ad\nticulated nearly 60 years ago in New Jersey v. New York,\n345 U. S. 369 (1953) (per curiam). Accordingly, we over\u00ad\nrule South Carolina\u2019s exceptions with respect to the Ca\u00ad\ntawba River Water Supply Project (hereinafter CRWSP)\nand Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (hereinafter Duke En\u00ad\nergy), but we sustain South Carolina\u2019s exception with\nrespect to the city of Charlotte, North Carolina (hereinaf\u00ad\nter Charlotte).\n\f2          SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   We granted leave for South Carolina to file its complaint\nin this matter two years ago. South Carolina v. North\nCarolina, 552 U. S. 804 (2007). The gravamen of the\ncomplaint is that North Carolina has authorized upstream\ntransfers of water from the Catawba River basin that\nexceed North Carolina\u2019s equitable share of the river. It\nhas done so, according to the complaint, pursuant to a\nNorth Carolina statute that requires any person seeking\nto transfer more than 2 million gallons of water per day\n(mgd) from the Catawba River basin to obtain a permit\nfrom the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission.        See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7143\u2013\n215.22L(a)(1) (Lexis 2007); \u00a7143\u2013215.22G(1)(h). Through\nthat agency, the complaint alleges, North Carolina has\nissued at least two such permits, one to Charlotte for the\ntransfer of up to 33 mgd, and one to the North Carolina\ncities of Concord and Kannapolis for the transfer of 10\nmgd. In addition, the complaint alleges, North Carolina\u2019s\npermitting statute \u201cgrandfathers\u201d a 5 mgd transfer by the\nCRWSP, and \u201cimplicitly authorize[s]\u201d an unknown number\nof transfers of less than 2 mgd. Complaint \u00b6\u00b618, 21, 22.\nSouth Carolina claims that the net effect of these up\u00ad\nstream transfers is to deprive South Carolina of its equi\u00ad\ntable share of the Catawba River\u2019s water, particularly\nduring periods of drought or low river flow.\n   South Carolina seeks relief in the form of a decree that\nequitably apportions the Catawba River between the two\nStates, enjoins North Carolina from authorizing transfers\nof water from the Catawba River exceeding that State\u2019s\nequitable share, and declares North Carolina\u2019s permitting\nstatute invalid to the extent it is used to authorize trans\u00ad\nfers of water from the Catawba River that exceed North\nCarolina\u2019s equitable share. See generally Complaint,\nPrayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b61\u20133. The complaint does not specify a\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nminimum flow of water that would satisfy South Caro\u00ad\nlina\u2019s equitable needs, but it does offer a point of reference.\nIn a recent \u201cmulti-stakeholder negotiation process\u201d involv\u00ad\ning the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (hereinaf\u00ad\nter FERC), Duke Energy, and various groups from both\nStates, it was agreed, according to the complaint, that\nSouth Carolina should receive from the Catawba River a\ncontinuous flow of water of no less than 1,100 cubic feet\nper second, or about 711 mgd. Complaint \u00b614.\n   This negotiated figure may prove unattainable. Accord\u00ad\ning to the complaint, natural conditions and periodic\nfluctuations have caused the Catawba River\u2019s flow to fall\nbelow 1,100 cubic feet per second. Duke Energy, which\ngenerates hydroelectric power from a series of reservoirs\non the Catawba River, developed a model to estimate the\nriver\u2019s flow if the river were not impounded. Id., \u00b6\u00b68, 16.\nThe complaint notes that according to Duke Energy\u2019s\nmodel, the Catawba River\u2014even in its natural state\u2014\noften would not deliver into South Carolina a minimum\naverage daily flow of 1,100 cubic feet per second. Id., \u00b616;\nApp. to Motion of State of South Carolina for Leave to File\nComplaint, Complaint, and Brief in Support of its Motion\nfor Leave to File Complaint 18. South Carolina contends\nthat North Carolina\u2019s authorization of large transfers of\nwater from the Catawba River basin has exacerbated\nthese conditions.\n   Shortly after we granted leave to file the complaint, two\nof the entities named in the complaint\u2014the CRWSP and\nDuke Energy\u2014filed motions for leave to intervene as\nparties. The CRWSP sought leave to intervene as a party\u00ad\ndefendant, asserting its interest as a \u201criparian user of the\nCatawba River\u201d and claiming that this interest was not\nadequately represented because of the CRWSP\u2019s \u201cinter\u00ad\nstate nature.\u201d Motion of Catawba River Water Supply\nProject for Leave to Intervene and Brief in Support of\nMotion 8, 9. Specifically, the CRWSP noted that it is a\n\f4            SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbistate entity that is jointly owned and regulated by, and\nsupplies water to, North Carolina\u2019s Union County and\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Lancaster County. Id., at 9. Duke En\u00ad\nergy sought leave to intervene and file an answer, assert\u00ad\ning an interest as the operator of 11 dams and reservoirs\non the Catawba River that control the river\u2019s flow, as the\nholder of a 50-year license1 governing Duke Energy\u2019s\nhydroelectric power operations, and as the entity that\norchestrated the multistakeholder negotiation process\nculminating in a Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement\n(CRA) signed by 70 entities from both States in 2006.\nDuke Energy Carolinas, LLC\u2019s Motion and Brief in Sup\u00ad\nport of Motion to Intervene and File Answer, and Answer\n2, 5. This CRA set forth the terms under which Duke\nEnergy has applied to renew its FERC license, id., at 5,\nand Duke Energy asserted that neither State would repre\u00ad\nsent its \u201cparticular amalgam of federal, state and private\ninterests,\u201d id., at 14. South Carolina opposed both mo\u00ad\ntions, and we referred them to the Special Master. 552\nU. S. 1160 (2008).\n   One month later, a third entity named in the complaint,\nthe city of Charlotte, also sought leave to intervene as a\nparty-defendant. In its brief, Charlotte asserted an inter\u00ad\nest, both as the holder of a permit authorizing the transfer\nof 33 mgd from the Catawba River basin\u2014the largest\nsingle transfer identified in the complaint\u2014and as the\npotential source of the 10 mgd transfer approved for the\ncities of Concord and Kannapolis. Motion for Leave to\nIntervene of City of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Brief\nin Support of Motion 5, 7.2 Charlotte argued that North\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The license was issued in 1958 to Duke Energy\u2019s predecessor by the\n\nFederal Power Commission, a predecessor of the FERC. For conven\u00ad\nience, we will refer to Duke Energy\u2019s \u201cFERC license\u201d herein.\n  2 Charlotte also asserted an interest in protecting the terms of the\n\nCRA, to which Charlotte was a signatory but to which North Carolina,\nwhich has conflicting duties under \u00a7401 of the Clean Water Act, 86\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCarolina could not represent the city\u2019s interests effectively\nbecause the State was duty bound to represent the inter\u00ad\nests of all North Carolina users of the Catawba River\u2019s\nwater, including users whose interests were not aligned\nwith Charlotte\u2019s. Id., at 17. South Carolina also opposed\nCharlotte\u2019s motion, and we referred it to the Special Mas\u00ad\nter. 552 U. S. 1254 (2008).\n                             B\n   The Special Master held a hearing and issued an order\ngranting all three motions for leave to intervene. At South\nCarolina\u2019s request, the Special Master set forth her find\u00ad\nings and decision as a First Interim Report, and it is this\nReport to which South Carolina now presents exceptions.\n   The Special Master recognized that this Court has\nexercised jurisdiction over nonstate parties in original\nactions between two or more States. She also recognized\nthat in New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S. 369, the Court\nconsidered the \u201cappropriate standard\u201d for a nonstate\nentity\u2019s motion to intervene in an original action. First\nInterim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138,\nOrig., p. 12 (First Interim Rept.). But in attempting to\ngive context to our standard, she looked beyond interven\u00ad\ntion and considered original actions in which the Court\nhas allowed nonstate entities to be named as defendants\nby the complaining State. From those examples, the\nSpecial Master \u201cdistilled the following rule\u201d governing\nmotions to intervene in original actions by nonstate\nentities:\n     \u201cAlthough the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction presump\u00ad\n     tively is reserved for disputes between sovereign\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStat. 877, as added, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71341, was not. North Carolina op\u00ad\nposed this argument, and the Special Master did not rely on it in\nrecommending that Charlotte\u2019s motion to intervene should be granted.\nAs Charlotte does not reassert this argument here, we do not consider\nit.\n\f6           SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    states over sovereign matters, nonstate entities may\n    become parties to such original disputes in appropri\u00ad\n    ate and compelling circumstances, such as where the\n    nonstate entity is the instrumentality authorized to\n    carry out the wrongful conduct or injury for which the\n    complaining state seeks relief, where the nonstate en\u00ad\n    tity has an independent property interest that is di\u00ad\n    rectly implicated by the original dispute or is a sub\u00ad\n    stantial factor in the dispute, where the nonstate\n    entity otherwise has a \u2018direct stake\u2019 in the outcome of\n    the action within the meaning of the Court\u2019s cases\n    discussed above, or where, together with one or more\n    of the above circumstances, the presence of the non\u00ad\n    state entity would advance the \u2018full exposition\u2019 of the\n    issues.\u201d Id., at 20\u201321.\n  Applying this broad rule, the Special Master found that\neach proposed intervenor had a sufficiently compelling\ninterest to justify intervention. The Special Master re\u00ad\njected South Carolina\u2019s proposal to limit intervention to\nthe remedy phase of this litigation and recommended that\nthis Court grant the motions to intervene.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Participation by nonstate parties in actions arising\nunder our original jurisdiction is not a new development.\nArticle III, \u00a72, of the Constitution expressly contemplates\nsuits \u201cbetween a State and Citizens of another State\u201d as\nfalling within our original jurisdiction, see, e.g., Georgia v.\nBrailsford, 2 Dall. 402 (1792), and for more than two\ncenturies the Court has exercised that jurisdiction over\nnonstate parties in suits between two or more States, see\nNew York v. Connecticut, 4 Dall. 1 (1799); Missouri v.\nIllinois, 180 U. S. 208, 224\u2013225 (1901). Nonstate entities\nhave even participated as parties in disputes between\nStates, such as the one before us now, where the States\n\f                      Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                        7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwere seeking equitable apportionment of water resources.\nSee, e.g., Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 608, n. 1\n(1983); Texas v. New Mexico, 343 U. S. 932 (1952); New\nJersey v. City of New York, 279 U. S. 823 (1929) (per cu\nriam). It is, thus, not a novel proposition to accord party\nstatus to a citizen in an original action between States.\n  This Court likewise has granted leave, under appropri\u00ad\nate circumstances, for nonstate entities to intervene as\nparties in original actions between States for nearly 90\nyears. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745,\nn. 21 (1981). In Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 581,\n598 (1922), a boundary dispute that threatened to erupt in\narmed hostilities, the Court allowed individual and corpo\u00ad\nrate citizens to intervene to protect their rights in con\u00ad\ntested land. See, e.g., Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609\n(1920).3 More recently, the Court has allowed a munici\u00ad\npality to intervene in a sovereign boundary dispute, see\nTexas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465, 466 (1976) (per curiam),\nand has permitted private corporations to intervene in an\noriginal action challenging a State\u2019s imposition of a tax\nthat burdened interstate commerce and contravened the\nSupremacy Clause, see Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, at\n745, n. 21.\n  In this case, the Special Master crafted a rule of inter\u00ad\nvention that accounts for the full compass of our prece\u00ad\ndents. But a compelling reason for allowing citizens to\nparticipate in one original action is not necessarily a com\u00ad\npelling reason for allowing citizens to intervene in all\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 THE  CHIEF JUSTICE argues against drawing conclusions from the\nintervention that we allowed in Oklahoma v. Texas, 254 U. S. 609\n(1920). See post, at 7\u20138 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). But the circumstances surrounding that dispute fit\nthe \u201c \u2018model case\u2019 \u201d for invoking this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, post, at\n2, and counsel against inferring from our precedents, as THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE does with respect to equitable apportionment actions, a rule\nagainst nonstate intervention in such \u201cweighty controversies,\u201d ibid.\n\f8             SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noriginal actions. We therefore decline to adopt the Special\nMaster\u2019s proposed rule. As the Special Master acknowl\u00ad\nedged, the Court in New Jersey v. New York, supra, set\ndown the \u201cappropriate standard\u201d for intervention in origi\u00ad\nnal actions by nonstate entities. First Interim Rept. 12.\nWe believe the standard that we applied in that case\napplies equally well here.4\n  In 1929, the State of New Jersey sued the State of New\nYork and city of New York for their diversion of the Dela\u00ad\nware River\u2019s headwaters. 345 U. S., at 370. The Court\ngranted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania leave to\nintervene, and in 1931, entered a decree enjoining certain\ndiversions of water by the State of New York and the city\nof New York. Id., at 371. In 1952, the city of New York\nmoved to modify the decree, and New Jersey and Pennsyl\u00ad\nvania filed oppositions. After the Court referred the mat\u00ad\nter to a special master, the city of Philadelphia sought\nleave to intervene on the basis of its use of the Delaware\nRiver\u2019s water. Id., at 371\u2013372.\n  This Court denied Philadelphia leave to intervene.\nPennsylvania had intervened pro interesse suo \u201cto protect\nthe rights and interests of Philadelphia and Eastern\nPennsylvania in the Delaware River.\u201d Id., at 374; see also\nNew Jersey v. New York, 283 U. S. 336, 342 (1931). In\nview of Pennsylvania\u2019s participation, the Court wrote that\nwhen a State is \u201ca party to a suit involving a matter of\nsovereign interest,\u201d it is parens patriae and \u201c \u2018must be\ndeemed to represent all [of] its citizens.\u2019 \u201d 345 U.

This principle serves the twin purposes of\nensuring that due respect is given to \u201csovereign dignity\u201d\nand providing \u201ca working rule for good judicial admini\u00ad\nstration.\u201d 345 U. S., at 373. The Court, thus, set forth the\nfollowing standard governing intervention in an original\naction by a nonstate entity:\n    \u201cAn intervenor whose state is already a party should\n    have the burden of showing some compelling interest\n    in his own right, apart from his interest in a class\n    with all other citizens and creatures of the state,\n    which interest is not properly represented by the\n    state.\u201d Ibid.\nOn several subsequent occasions the Court has reaffirmed\nthis \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d See Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1,\n21\u201322 (1995); United States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 538\n(1973) (per curiam); Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 97\n(1972).\n   We acknowledge that the standard for intervention in\noriginal actions by nonstate entities is high\u2014and appro\u00ad\npriately so. Such actions tax the limited resources of this\nCourt by requiring us \u201cawkwardly to play the role of fact\u00ad\nfinder\u201d and diverting our attention from our \u201cprimary\nresponsibility as an appellate tribunal.\u201d Ohio v. Wyan\ndotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498 (1971); Mary\nland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 762 (1981) (Rehnquist,\nJ., dissenting). In order to ensure that original actions do\nnot assume the \u201cdimensions of ordinary class actions,\u201d\nNew Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373, we exercise our\noriginal jurisdiction \u201csparingly\u201d and retain \u201csubstantial\ndiscretion\u201d to decide whether a particular claim requires\n\u201can original forum in this Court,\u201d Mississippi v. Louisiana,\n506 U. S. 73, 76 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respect for state sovereignty also calls for a high\nthreshold to intervention by nonstate parties in a sover\u00ad\neign dispute committed to this Court\u2019s original jurisdic\u00ad\n\f10           SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion. Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71251, this Court exercises \u201corigi\u00ad\nnal and exclusive\u201d jurisdiction to resolve controversies\nbetween States that, if arising among independent na\u00ad\ntions, \u201cwould be settled by treaty or by force.\u201d Kansas v.\nColorado, 206 U. S. 46, 98 (1907). This Court has de\u00ad\nscribed its original jurisdiction as \u201cdelicate and grave,\u201d\nLouisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), and has\nguarded against its use as a forum in which \u201ca state might\nbe judicially impeached on matters of policy by its own\nsubjects,\u201d New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373. In\nits sovereign capacity, a State represents the interests of\nits citizens in an original action, the disposition of which\nbinds the citizens. Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at 22;\nNew Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 372\u2013373. A respect\nfor sovereign dignity, therefore, counsels in favor of re\u00ad\nstraint in allowing nonstate entities to intervene in such\ndisputes. See ibid.; accord, United States v. Texas, 143\nU. S. 621, 643 (1892) (\u201c[E]xclusive jurisdiction was given\nto this court, because it best comported with the dignity of\na State, that a case in which it was a party should be\ndetermined in the highest, rather than in a subordinate\njudicial tribunal of the nation\u201d).5\n   That the standard for intervention in original actions by\nnonstate entities is high, however, does not mean that it is\ninsurmountable. Indeed, as the Special Master correctly\nrecognized, our practice long has been to allow such inter\u00ad\nvention in compelling circumstances. See Oklahoma v.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 South Carolina has not invoked the Eleventh Amendment as a basis\n\nfor opposing intervention. It has noted, however, that the proposed\nintervenors\u2019 claims are, in effect, against South Carolina, and thus has\nreserved the right to argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars particu\u00ad\nlar forms of relief sought by the proposed intervenors. As in New Jersey\nv. New York, 345 U. S. 369, 372 (1953) (per curiam), we express no view\nwhether the Eleventh Amendment is implicated where a nonstate\nentity seeks to intervene as a defendant in an original action over a\nState\u2019s objection.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nTexas, 258 U. S., at 581. Over the \u201cstrong objections\u201d of\nthree States, for example, the Court allowed Indian tribes\nto intervene in a sovereign dispute concerning the equita\u00ad\nble apportionment of the Colorado River. Arizona v. Cali\nfornia, 460 U. S., at 613. The Court did so notwithstand\u00ad\ning the Tribes\u2019 simultaneous representation by the United\nStates. Id., at 608\u2013609, 612. And in a boundary dispute\namong Texas, Louisiana, and the United States, the Court\nallowed the city of Port Arthur, Texas, to intervene for the\npurpose of protecting its interests in islands in which the\nUnited States claimed title. Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S.,\nat 466; Texas v. Louisiana, 416 U. S. 965 (1974). In both\nof these examples, the Court found compelling interests\nthat warranted allowing nonstate entities to intervene in\noriginal actions in which the intervenors were nominally\nrepresented by sovereign parties.\n                             B\n                             1\n  Applying the standard of New Jersey v. New York, su\npra, here, we conclude that the CRWSP has demonstrated\na sufficiently compelling interest that is unlike the inter\u00ad\nests of other citizens of the States. The CRWSP is an\nunusual municipal entity, established as a joint venture\nwith the encouragement of regulatory authorities in both\nStates and designed to serve the increasing water needs of\nUnion County, North Carolina, and Lancaster County,\nSouth Carolina. It has an advisory board consisting of\nrepresentatives from both counties, draws its revenues\nfrom its bistate sales, and operates infrastructure and\nassets that are owned by both counties as tenants-in\u00ad\ncommon. We are told that approximately 100,000 indi\u00ad\nviduals in each State receive their water from the CRWSP\nand that \u201croughly half\u201d of the CRWSP\u2019s total withdrawals\nof water from the Catawba River go to South Carolina\nconsumers. Reply of Catawba River Water Supply Project\n\f12         SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto Exceptions of South Carolina to First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master 22 (hereinafter CRWSP Reply). It is diffi\u00ad\ncult to conceive of a more purely bistate entity.\n  In addition, the CRWSP relies upon authority granted\nby both States to draw water from the Catawba River and\ntransfer that water from the Catawba River basin. The\nCRWSP draws all of its water from an intake located\nbelow the Lake Wylie dam in South Carolina. South\nCarolina licensed the CRWSP to withdraw a total of 100\nmgd from the Catawba River and issued a certificate to\nthe CRWSP in 1989 authorizing up to 20 mgd to be trans\u00ad\nferred out of the Catawba River basin. Id., at 6\u20137; Answer\nto Bill of Complaint \u00b621. Lancaster County currently uses\napproximately 2 mgd of this amount, Union County uses\napproximately 5 mgd, and the remaining 13 mgd are not\nused at this time. CRWSP Reply 7. The CRWSP pumps\nUnion County\u2019s allocation across the state border pursu\u00ad\nant to a parallel certificate issued by North Carolina\nauthorizing a 5 mgd transfer, ibid., and the complaint\nspecifically identifies this transfer as contributing to\nSouth Carolina\u2019s harm, Complaint \u00b621.             Thus, the\nCRWSP\u2019s activities depend upon authority conferred by\nboth States.\n  On these facts, we think it is clear that the CRWSP has\ncarried its burden of showing a compelling interest in the\noutcome of this litigation that distinguishes the CRWSP\nfrom all other citizens of the party States. See New Jersey\nv. New York, supra, at 373. Apart from its interest as a\nuser of the Catawba River\u2019s water, the CRWSP has made\na $30 million investment in its plant and infrastructure,\nwith each participating county incurring approximately\nhalf of this cost as debt. Each county is responsible for\none-half of the CRWSP\u2019s cost of operations, and the ven\u00ad\nture is designed to break even from year to year. Any\ndisruption to the CRWSP\u2019s operations would increase\u2014not\nlessen\u2014the difficulty of our task in achieving a \u201cjust and\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nequitable\u201d allocation in this dispute. See Nebraska v.\nWyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 618 (1945). We believe that the\nCRWSP has shown a compelling interest in protecting the\nviability of its operations, which are premised on a fine\nbalance between the joint venture\u2019s two participating\ncounties.\n   We are further persuaded that neither State can prop\u00ad\nerly represent the interests of the CRWSP in this litiga\u00ad\ntion. See New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373. The\ncomplaint attributes a portion of the total water transfers\nthat have harmed South Carolina to the CRWSP, yet\nNorth Carolina expressly states that it \u201ccannot represent\nthe interests of the joint venture.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. A\nmoment\u2019s reflection reveals why this is so. In this dispute,\nas in all disputes over limited resources, each State maxi\u00ad\nmizes its equitable share of the Catawba River\u2019s water\nonly by arguing that the other State\u2019s equitable share\nmust be reduced. See, e.g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 459\nU. S. 176, 186\u2013187 (1982). It is thus likely that North\nCarolina, in response to South Carolina\u2019s demand for a\ngreater share of the Catawba River\u2019s water, will take the\nposition that downstream users\u2014such as Lancaster\nCounty6\u2014should receive less water. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n52 (\u201cFrom North Carolina\u2019s perspective, South Carolina is\nreceiving much more water under this negotiated agree\u00ad\nment than they could ever hope to achieve in an equitable\napportionment action\u201d). The stresses that this litigation\nwould place upon the CRWSP threaten to upset the fine\nbalance on which the joint venture is premised, and nei\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 As a further complication, we are told, Lancaster County has an\n\nobligation to provide water service to certain customers in Mecklenburg\nCounty, North Carolina. CRWSP Reply 6. Thus, South Carolina may\nnot be interested in protecting all uses of Lancaster County\u2019s share of\nthe CRWSP\u2019s water. This additional intermingling of state interests\nfurther supports our conclusion that neither State adequately repre\u00ad\nsents the CRWSP\u2019s inherently bistate interests.\n\f14          SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nther State has sufficient interest in maintaining that\nbalance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP\u2019s\ninterests.\n  Accordingly, we believe that the CRWSP should be\nallowed to intervene to represent its own compelling inter\u00ad\nests in this litigation. We thus overrule South Carolina\u2019s\nexception.\n                               2\n   We conclude, as well, that Duke Energy has demon\u00ad\nstrated powerful interests that likely will shape the out\u00ad\ncome of this litigation. To place these interests in context,\nit is instructive to consider the \u201cflexible\u201d process by which\nwe arrive at a \u201c \u2018just and equitable apportionment\u2019 \u201d of an\ninterstate stream. Colorado v. New Mexico, supra, at 183.\nWe do not approach the task in formulaic fashion, New\nJersey v. New York, 283 U. S., at 343, but we consider \u201call\nrelevant factors,\u201d including, but not limited to:\n     \u201c \u2018physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive\n     use of water in the several sections of the river, the\n     character and rate of return flows, the extent of estab\u00ad\n     lished uses, the availability of storage water, the prac\u00ad\n     tical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas,\n     [and] the damage to upstream areas as compared to\n     the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is im\u00ad\n     posed on the former.\u2019 \u201d Colorado v. New Mexico, su\n     pra, at 183 (quoting Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra, at\n     618).\nIn performing this task, there is no substitute for \u201c \u2018the\nexercise of an informed judgment,\u2019 \u201d Colorado v. New\nMexico, supra, at 183, and we will not hesitate to seek out\nthe most relevant information from the source best situ\u00ad\nated to provide it. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S.,\nat 745, n. 21 (allowing intervention of private pipeline\ncompanies \u201cin the interest of a full exposition of the\n\f                   Cite as: 558 U.

Duke Energy operates 11\ndams and reservoirs in both States that generate electric\u00ad\nity for the region and control the flow of the river. The\ncomplaint itself acknowledges the relationship between\nriver flow and Duke Energy\u2019s operations, noting that a\nsevere drought that ended in 2002 forced Duke Energy to\n\u201creduce dramatically\u201d its hydroelectric power generation\nfrom the Catawba River. Complaint \u00b617(c). It is likely\nthat any equitable apportionment of the river will need to\ntake into account the amount of water that Duke Energy\nneeds to sustain its operations and provide electricity to\nthe region, thus giving Duke Energy a strong interest in\nthe outcome of this litigation. See Colorado v. New Mex\nico, supra, at 188 (noting the appropriateness of consider\u00ad\ning \u201cthe balance of harm and benefit that might result\u201d\nfrom a State\u2019s proposed diversion of a river). There is,\nmoreover, no other similarly situated entity on the Ca\u00ad\ntawba River, setting Duke\u2019s interests apart from the class\nof all other citizens of the States. See New Jersey v. New\nYork, supra, at 373.\n   Just as important, Duke Energy has a unique and com\u00ad\npelling interest in protecting the terms of its existing\nFERC license and the CRA that forms the basis of Duke\nEnergy\u2019s pending renewal application.7 Through its dams,\nDuke Energy controls the flow of the Catawba River under\nthe terms of its 50-year FERC license, which regulates the\nvery subject matter in dispute: the river\u2019s minimum flow\ninto South Carolina. See Order Issuing License (Major),\nDuke Power Co., Project No. 2232, 20 F. P. C. 360, 371\u2013372\n(1958) (Articles 31 and 32). The CRA, likewise, represents\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Duke Energy is operating under a temporary extension of its 50\u00ad\n\nyear FERC license, which expired in 2008, and the CRA represents\nDuke Energy\u2019s investment in a new 50-year license.\n\f16         SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe full consensus of 70 parties from both States regarding\nthe appropriate minimum continuous flow of Catawba\nRiver water into South Carolina under a variety of natural\nconditions and, in times of drought, the conservation\nmeasures to be taken by entities that withdraw water\nfrom the Catawba River. These factors undeniably are\nrelevant to any \u201cjust and equitable apportionment\u201d of the\nCatawba River, see Colorado v. New Mexico, 459 U. S., at\n183, and we are likely to consider them in reaching our\nultimate disposition of this case. Thus, we find that Duke\nEnergy has carried its burden of showing unique and\ncompelling interests.\n   We also have little difficulty in concluding that neither\nState sufficiently represents these compelling interests.\nNeither State has signed the CRA or expressed an inten\u00ad\ntion to defend its terms. To the contrary, North Carolina\nhas expressed an intention to seek its modification. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 51\u201352. Given the importance of Duke Energy\u2019s\ninterests and their relevance to our ultimate decision, we\nbelieve these interests should be represented by a party in\nthis action, and we find that neither State is situated to do\nso properly. We believe that Duke Energy should be\npermitted to represent its own interests.\n   For these reasons, we agree with the Special Master\nthat Duke Energy should be permitted to intervene, and\nwe overrule South Carolina\u2019s exception in that regard.\n                             3\n  We conclude, however, that Charlotte has not carried its\nburden of showing a sufficient interest for intervention in\nthis action. Charlotte is a municipality of North Carolina,\nand for purposes of this litigation, its transfers of water\nfrom the Catawba River basin constitute part of North\nCarolina\u2019s equitable share. While it is true that the com\u00ad\nplaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North\nCarolina to carry out a large transfer of water from the\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCatawba River basin, the complaint does not seek relief\nagainst Charlotte directly. Rather, the complaint seeks\nrelief against all North Carolina-authorized transfers of\nwater from the Catawba River basin, \u201cpast or future,\u201d in\nexcess of North Carolina\u2019s equitable share. Complaint,\nPrayer for Relief \u00b62. Charlotte, therefore, occupies a class\nof affected North Carolina users of water, and the magni\u00ad\ntude of Charlotte\u2019s authorized transfer does not distin\u00ad\nguish it in kind from other members of the class. See New\nJersey v. New York, 345 U. S., at 373, and n. (noting that\nPhiladelphia represented half of the Pennsylvania\u2019s citi\u00ad\nzens in the watershed). Nor does Charlotte represent\ninterstate interests that fall on both sides of this dispute,\nas the CRWSP does, such that the viability of Charlotte\u2019s\noperations in the face of this litigation is called into ques\u00ad\ntion. Its interest is solely as a user of North Carolina\u2019s\nshare of the Catawba River\u2019s water.\n   Charlotte\u2019s interest falls squarely within the category of\ninterests with respect to which a State must be deemed to\nrepresent all of its citizens. As we recognized in New\nJersey v. New York, a State\u2019s sovereign interest in ensur\u00ad\ning an equitable share of an interstate river\u2019s water is\nprecisely the type of interest that the State, as parens\npatrie, represents on behalf of its citizens. See also United\nStates v. Nevada, 412 U. S., at 539; Nebraska v. Wyoming,\n325 U. S., at 616. That is why, in New Jersey v. New York,\nsupra, we required that a proposed intervenor show a\ncompelling interest \u201cin his own right,\u201d distinct from the\ncollective interest of \u201call other citizens and creatures of the\nstate,\u201d whose interest the State presumptively represents\nin matters of sovereign policy. Id., at 373. We conclude\nthat Charlotte has not carried that burden. Thus, respect\nfor \u201csovereign dignity\u201d requires us to recognize that North\nCarolina properly represents Charlotte in this dispute\nover a matter of uniquely sovereign interest. See ibid.\n   North Carolina\u2019s own statements only reinforce this\n\f18            SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nconclusion.

Brief of State of North Carolina in\nOpposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Exceptions 22. Indeed, in re\u00ad\nsponse to Charlotte\u2019s motion to intervene, North Carolina\nwrote the following:\n     \u201c[T]he State must represent the interests of every per\u00ad\n     son that uses water from the North Carolina portion\n     of the Catawba River basin. In fact, the State has a\n     particular concern for its political subdivisions, such\n     as Charlotte, which actually operate the infrastruc\u00ad\n     ture to provide water to the State\u2019s citizens. . . . The\n     State has every reason to defend the [transfers] that it\n     has authorized for the benefit of its citizens. The\n     State cannot agree with any implication that because\n     it represents all of the users of water in North Caro\u00ad\n     lina it cannot, or will not represent the interests of\n     Charlotte in this litigation initiated by South Caro\u00ad\n     lina.\u201d Brief for State of North Carolina in Response to\n     City of Charlotte\u2019s Motion for Leave to Intervene and\n     File Answer 1\u20132.\nThese statements are consistent with North Carolina\u2019s\nrole as parens patriae, and we see no reason that North\nCarolina cannot represent Charlotte\u2019s interest in this\nsovereign dispute. See New Jersey v. New York, supra, at\n374 (noting that Philadelphia\u2019s interest \u201cis invariably\nserved by the Commonwealth\u2019s position\u201d).\n  Because we are not persuaded that Charlotte\u2019s interest\nis sufficiently unique and not properly represented by\nNorth Carolina to require the city\u2019s intervention as a party\nin this litigation, we sustain South Carolina\u2019s exception.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 8 Federal   Rule of Civil Procedure 24 does not require a contrary re\u00ad\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Even if we were to look to the\nstandard for intervention of right in civil matters, Charlotte would not\nbe entitled to intervene in this dispute because an existing party\u2014\nNorth Carolina\u2014adequately represents Charlotte\u2019s interest.

The majority goes on, however, to misapply our\nestablished test in granting intervention to Duke Energy\nCarolinas, LLC (Duke Energy), and the Catawba River\nWater Supply Project (CRWSP).\n  The result is literally unprecedented: Even though\nequitable apportionment actions are a significant part of\nour original docket, this Court has never before granted\nintervention in such a case to an entity other than a State,\nthe United States, or an Indian tribe. Never. That is\nbecause the apportionment of an interstate waterway is a\nsovereign dispute, and the key to intervention in such an\naction is just that\u2014sovereignty. The Court\u2019s decision to\npermit nonsovereigns to intervene in this case has the\npotential to alter in a fundamental way the nature of our\noriginal jurisdiction, transforming it from a means of\nresolving high disputes between sovereigns into a forum\nfor airing private interests. Given the importance of\nmaintaining the proper limits on that jurisdiction, I re\nspectfully dissent.\n\f2           SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n                                I\n   Two basic principles have guided the exercise of our\nconstitutionally conferred original jurisdiction. The first is\nan appreciation that our original jurisdiction, \u201cdelicate\nand grave,\u201d Louisiana v. Texas, 176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), was\ngranted to provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of\nweighty controversies involving the States. \u201cThe model\ncase for invocation of this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction is a\ndispute between States of such seriousness that it would\namount to casus belli if the States were fully sovereign.\u201d\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 571, n. 18 (1983). In\ndetermining whether to exercise original jurisdiction, we\naccordingly focus on \u201cthe nature of the interest of the\ncomplaining State,\u201d and in particular the \u201cseriousness and\ndignity\u201d of the claim asserted. Mississippi v. Louisiana,\n506 U. S. 73, 77 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Original jurisdiction is for the resolution of state claims,\nnot private claims. To invoke that jurisdiction, a State\n\u201cmust, of course, represent an interest of her own and not\nmerely that of her citizens or corporations.\u201d Arkansas v.\nTexas, 346 U. S. 368, 370 (1953); see Kansas v. Colorado,\n533 U. S. 1, 8\u20139 (2001); Pennsylvania v. New Jersey, 426\nU. S. 660, 665 (1976) (per curiam) (It is \u201csettled doctrine\nthat a State has standing to sue only when its sovereign or\nquasi-sovereign interests are implicated and it is not\nmerely litigating as a volunteer the personal claims of its\ncitizens\u201d). And in deciding whether a State meets that\nrequirement, this Court considers whether the State is \u201cin\nfull control of [the] litigation.\u201d Kansas v. Colorado, supra,\nat 8.\n   The second guiding principle is a practical one: We are\nnot well suited to assume the role of a trial judge. See\nOhio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U. S. 493, 498\n(1971). We have attempted to address that reality by\nrelying on the services of able special masters, who have\nbecome vitally important in allowing us to manage our\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

But the responsibility for the exercise of\nthis Court\u2019s original jurisdiction remains ours alone under\nthe Constitution.\n   These two considerations\u2014that our original jurisdiction\nis limited to high claims affecting state sovereignty, and\nthat practical realities limit our ability to act as a trial\ncourt\u2014converge in our standard for intervention in origi\nnal actions. We articulated that standard in New Jersey v.\nNew York, 345 U. S. 369, 373 (1953) (per curiam). There,\nwe denied the city of Philadelphia\u2019s motion for leave to\nintervene in an action, to which the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania was already a party, involving the appor\ntionment of the Delaware River. Id., at 373\u2013374. We set\nout the following test for intervention in an original action:\n\u201cAn intervenor whose state is already a party should have\nthe burden of showing some compelling interest in his own\nright, apart from his interest in a class with all other\ncitizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not\nproperly represented by the state.\u201d Id., at 373.\n   This exacting standard is grounded on a \u201cnecessary\nrecognition of sovereign dignity,\u201d id., at 373, under which\n\u201cthe state, when a party to a suit involving a matter of\nsovereign interest, \u2018must be deemed to represent all its\ncitizens,\u2019 \u201d id., at 372 (quoting Kentucky v. Indiana, 281\nU. S. 163, 173\u2013174 (1930)). In applying that doctrine to\nmotions to intervene, the New Jersey v. New York test\nprecludes a State from being \u201cjudicially impeached on\nmatters of policy by its own subjects,\u201d and prevents the\nuse of the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to air \u201cintramural\ndispute[s]\u201d that should be settled in a different forum\u2014\nnamely, within the States. 345 U. S., at 373.\n   The New Jersey v. New York test is also \u201ca working rule\nfor good judicial administration.\u201d Ibid. Without it, \u201cthere\nwould be no practical limitation on the number of citizens,\nas such, who would be entitled to be made parties.\u201d Ibid.\nIndeed, the Court observed that allowing Philadelphia to\n\f4          SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nintervene would have made it difficult to refuse attempts\nto intervene by other users of water from the Delaware\nRiver, including other cities, and even \u201c[l]arge industrial\nplants.\u201d Ibid. The New Jersey v. New York test, properly\napplied, provides a much-needed limiting principle that\nprevents the expansion of our original proceedings \u201cto the\ndimensions of ordinary class actions,\u201d ibid., or \u201ctown\nmeeting lawsuits,\u201d id., at 376 (Jackson, J., dissenting).\nSee also Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., supra, at\n504; Utah v. United States, 394 U. S. 89, 95\u201396 (1969) (per\ncuriam).\n                              II\n  Applying these principles, this Court has never granted\na nonsovereign entity\u2019s motion to intervene in an equitable\napportionment action. The reason is straightforward: An\ninterest in water is an interest shared with other citizens,\nand is properly pressed or defended by the State. And a\nprivate entity\u2019s interest in its particular share of the\nState\u2019s water, once the water is allocated between the\nStates, is an \u201cintramural dispute\u201d to be decided by each\nState on its own. New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373.\n  The interests of a State\u2019s citizens in the use of water\nderive entirely from the State\u2019s sovereign interest in the\nwaterway. If the State has no claim to the waters of an\ninterstate river, then its citizens have none either. See\nHinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co.,\n304 U. S. 92, 102 (1938). We have long recognized, there\nfore, that the State must be deemed to represent its citi\nzens\u2019 interests in an equitable apportionment action. See\nUnited States v. Nevada, 412 U. S. 534, 539 (1973) (per\ncuriam) (\u201cFor the purposes of dividing the waters of an\ninterstate stream with another State, [a State] has the\nright, parens patriae, to represent all the nonfederal users\nin its own State insofar as the share allocated to the other\nState is concerned\u201d). Precisely because the State repre\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nsents all its citizens in an equitable apportionment action,\nthese citizens have no claim themselves against the other\nState. They are instead \u201cbound by the result reached\nthrough representation by their respective States,\u201d regard\nless of whether those citizens are parties to the suit.\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S. 1, 22 (1995).\n   This basic principle applies without regard to whether\nthe State agrees with and will advance the particular\ninterest asserted by a specific private entity. The State\n\u201c \u2018must be deemed to represent all its citizens,\u2019 \u201d New Jer\nsey v. New York, supra, at 372 (quoting Kentucky v. Indi\nana, supra, at 173\u2013174; emphasis added), not just those\nwho subscribe to the State\u2019s position before this Court.\nThe directive that a State cannot be \u201cjudicially impeached\non matters of policy by its own subjects,\u201d New Jersey v.\nNew York, supra, at 373, obviously applies to the case in\nwhich a subject disagrees with the position of the State.\n   A State\u2019s citizens also need not be made parties to an\nequitable apportionment action because the Court\u2019s judg\nment in such an action does not determine the water\nrights of any individual citizen. We made that clear long\nago in two decisions arising from the same dispute, Wyo\nming v. Colorado, 298 U. S. 573 (1936), and Wyoming v.\nColorado, 309 U. S. 572 (1940). In those cases, Wyoming\nsought to enforce this Court\u2019s earlier decree apportioning\nthe Laramie River. See Wyoming v. Colorado, 260 U. S. 1\n(1922). We held that the decree controlled the allocation\nof water between Wyoming and Colorado, not within\nthem. As we recognized, our decision apportioning the\nriver did not \u201cwithdraw water claims dealt with therein\nfrom the operation of local laws relating to their transfer\nor . . . restrict their utilization in ways not affecting the\nrights of one State and her claimants as against the other\nState and her claimants.\u201d 298 U. S., at 584. Thus, al\nthough the decree referred to particular uses of water in\nColorado, we held that those individual uses could vary\n\f6            SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nfrom the terms set out in the decree, so long as the total\ndiversion of water in Colorado was no greater than the\ndecree allowed. See id., at 584\u2013585; 309 U. S., at 579\u2013581.\nWe reiterated the point in Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S.\n589, 627 (1945), observing that the apportionment of a\nwaterway between the States has only an \u201cindirect effect\u201d\non the rights of individuals within the States.\n   All this explains our long history of rejecting attempts\nby nonsovereign entities to intervene in equitable appor\ntionment actions. New Jersey v. New York was itself an\nequitable apportionment suit, and we denied intervention\nin that case. We have also summarily denied motions to\nintervene in other water disputes between the States. See\nArizona v. California, 514 U. S. 1081 (1995); Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 345 U. S. 914 (1953); Nebraska v. Wyoming,\n296 U. S. 548 (1935); Wisconsin v. Illinois, 279 U. S. 821\n(1929). And we have strongly intimated in other decisions\n(albeit in dictum) that private entities can rarely, if ever,\nintervene in original actions involving the apportionment\nof interstate waterways. See United States v. Nevada,\nsupra, at 538 (\u201c[I]ndividual users of water . . . ordinarily\nwould have no right to intervene in an original action in\nthis Court\u201d); Nebraska v. Wyoming, 515 U. S., at 22 (\u201cWe\nhave said on many occasions that water disputes among\nStates may be resolved by compact or decree without the\nparticipation of individual claimants\u201d).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Themajority contends that this dissent reads our precedents to\nestablish \u201ca rule against nonstate intervention\u201d in equitable appor\ntionment actions. Ante, at 7, n. 3. The number of nonsovereigns that\nthe Court should permit to intervene in water disputes is small\u2014\nindeed, it was zero until today. But that does not mean that a private\nentity could not satisfy the New Jersey v. New York test by, for exam\nple, asserting water-use rights that are not dependent upon the rights\nof state parties. A private party (or perhaps a Compact Clause entity)\nwith a federal statutory right to a certain quantity of water might have\na compelling interest in an equitable apportionment action that is not\nfairly represented by the States. The putative intervenors in this case,\n\f                      Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)       7\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The majority contends that the result in this case is not\na \u201cnew development,\u201d and that its holding is supported by\n\u201cnearly 90 years\u201d of precedent. Ante, at 6\u20137. But in sup\nport of those statements, the majority cites only four\ndecisions in which the Court has granted a motion to\nintervene in an original suit\u2014and of course none in which\nthis Court granted the motion of a nonsovereign entity to\nintervene in an equitable apportionment action. The cases\nthe majority cites demonstrate what constitutes a \u201ccompel\nling interest in [the intervenor\u2019s] own right, apart from his\ninterest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of\nthe state.\u201d New Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. But\nthe intervenor interests in those cases were quite different\nfrom the general shared interest in water at issue here.\n   Take Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983). There\nwe allowed several Indian Tribes to intervene in a water\ndispute. Id., at 615. As the Court in that case made clear,\nhowever, the Indian Tribes were allowed to intervene\nbecause they were sovereign entities. Ibid. The Court\ndistinguished New Jersey v. New York on that very\nground. See 460 U. S., at 615, n. 5.\n   The other cases relied upon by the majority are even\nfarther afield. See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725\n(1981); Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465 (1976) (per cu\nriam); Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574 (1922). None was\nan equitable apportionment action. Two involved bound\nary disputes in which the Court allowed nonsovereign\nintervenors to claim title to certain parcels of property.\nSee Texas v. Louisiana, supra, at 466 (permitting inter\nvention by the city of Port Arthur, Texas); Oklahoma v.\nTexas, supra, at 580\u2013581 (same for private parties). A\nclaim to title in a particular piece of property is quite\ndifferent from a general interest shared by all citizens in\nthe State\u2019s waters. And it would be particularly inapt to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhowever, do not hold rights of this sort. \n\n\f8          SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ndraw general conclusions about intervention from Okla\nhoma v. Texas, in which the Court took the southern half\nof the Red River into receivership. See 258 U. S., at 580.\nIn subsequently allowing persons to intervene to assert\nclaims to the subject property, the Court relied explicitly\non the fact that the receiver had possession and control of\nthe claimed parcels, and \u201cno other court lawfully [could]\ninterfere with or disturb that possession or control.\u201d Id.,\nat 581.\n  The majority\u2019s reliance on Maryland v. Louisiana is\nequally unavailing. There, several States challenged the\nconstitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s application of a tax on\nnatural gas that was brought into that State. 451 U. S., at\n728. In two sentences within a long footnote, the Court\nmentioned that it was permitting a group of pipeline\ncompanies to intervene and challenge the tax. Id., at 745,\nn. 21. The Court made clear that the pipeline companies\nwere able to intervene in light of the particular circum\nstances in that case\u2014namely, Louisiana\u2019s tax was \u201cdi\nrectly imposed on the owner of imported gas,\u201d and \u201cthe\npipelines most often own[ed] the gas.\u201d Ibid. Again, an\ninterest in a tax imposed only on discrete parties is obvi\nously different from a general interest shared by all citi\nzens of the State.\n                             III\n  Charlotte, Duke Energy, and CRWSP claim a variety of\nspecific needs for water to justify their intervention. But\nall those particular needs derive from an interest in the\nwater of the Catawba River. That interest is not exclu\nsive, but is instead shared \u201cwith all other citizens and\ncreatures of the state.\u201d New Jersey v. New York, 345 U. S.,\nat 373. The State\u2019s \u201ccitizens and creatures\u201d certainly put\nthe Catawba\u2019s water and flow to different uses\u2014many for\ndrinking water, some for farming or recreation, others for\ngenerating power. That does not, however, make their\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ninterest in the water itself unique. And it is the respective\ninterests of the States in the water itself that are being\nlitigated in this original action\u2014not the claims of particu\nlar citizens that they be allowed to put the water to speci\nfied uses. The latter subject is \u201can intramural dispute\nover the distribution of water within the [State],\u201d ibid.,\nand is not the subject of this original proceeding.\n   The majority recognizes as much with respect to Char\nlotte, ante, at 16\u201318, but departs from these principles in\ngranting intervention to Duke Energy and CRWSP. The\nmajority\u2019s reasons for doing so do not withstand scrutiny.\n   The majority initially contends that Duke Energy\nshould be allowed to intervene because it possesses \u201crele\nvant information\u201d that we are \u201clikely to consider.\u201d Ante, at\n14, 16. Nonparties often do, but that is not a \u201ccompelling\ninterest\u201d justifying intervention. I have little doubt that\nPhiladelphia possessed pertinent information in New\nJersey v. New York, but we did not permit Philadelphia to\nintervene on that ground. Parties to litigation have ready\nmeans of access to relevant information held by nonpar\nties, and those nonparties can certainly furnish such\ninformation on their own if they consider it in their best\ninterests (through, for example, participation as amici\ncuriae).\n   The majority also states that Duke Energy has compel\nling interests in its hydroelectric operations along the\nriver, and in \u201cthe amount of water that Duke Energy\nneeds to sustain its operations and provide electricity to\nthe region.\u201d Ante, at 15. These are simply interests in a\nparticular use of water or its flow. Even if Duke Energy\nuses water for particularly important purposes, its inter\nests are no different in kind from the interests of any other\nentity that relies on water for its commercial operations.\n   Finally, the majority asserts that Duke Energy \u201chas a\nunique and compelling interest in protecting the terms of\nits existing [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\f10         SOUTH CAROLINA v.

J.\n\n(FERC)] license and the [Comprehensive Licensing Agree\nment (CRA)] that forms the basis of Duke Energy\u2019s pend\ning renewal application.\u201d Ibid. And the majority contends\nthat neither State represents these interests because\n\u201c[n]either State has signed the CRA or expressed an inten\ntion to defend its terms,\u201d and because North Carolina has\neven expressed its intent to challenge the terms of the\nCRA in this action. Ante, at 16.\n   Again, all this amounts to is an articulation of the rea\nson Duke Energy asserts a particular interest in the wa\nters of the Catawba. Other citizens of North Carolina\ndoubtless have reasons of their own, ones they find as\nimportant as Duke Energy believes its to be. Weighing\nthose interests is an \u201cintramural\u201d matter for the State.\nNew Jersey v. New York, supra, at 373. In addition, the\nFederal Government is doubtless familiar with the pend\ning FERC proceedings, and it sees no corresponding need\nfor us to grant Duke Energy\u2019s motion to intervene. See\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20, n. 3.\n   As for CRWSP, the Special Master concluded that it\nshould be allowed to intervene, but only because its posi\ntion was \u201csimilar analytically to Charlotte\u2019s.\u201d First In\nterim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138, Orig.,\np. 25. The Court rejects Charlotte\u2019s motion, but nonethe\nless allows CRWSP to intervene on a ground not relied\nupon by the Special Master. According to the majority,\nCRWSP should be allowed to intervene because, as a\nbistate entity, its full range of interests cannot be repre\nsented entirely by either North or South Carolina. See\nante, at 11\u201314.\n   CRWSP\u2019s motion arguably presents a different case\nfrom that of Duke Energy, one not definitively resolved by\nthis Court in New Jersey v. New York. At the end of the\nday, however, I agree with the Special Master\u2019s premise\u2014\nCRWSP\u2019s position is really no different from Charlotte\u2019s. I\ndisagree with her conclusion, of course, because I agree\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nwith the Court that Charlotte should not be allowed to\nintervene.\n   A bistate entity cannot be allowed to intervene merely\nbecause it embodies an \u201cintermingling of state interests.\u201d\nAnte, at 13, n. 6. The same would be true of any bistate\nentity, or indeed any corporation or individual conducting\nbusiness in both States. An exception for such cases\nwould certainly swallow the New Jersey v. New York rule.\nEntities with interests in both States must seek to vindi\ncate those interests within each State. Bistate entities are\nnot States entitled to invoke our original jurisdiction, and\nshould not be effectively accorded an automatic right to\nintervene as parties in cases within that jurisdiction.\n   With respect to both Duke Energy and CRWSP, the\nmajority further relies on its conclusion that the States\nwill not \u201cproperly represent\u201d the interests of those entities.\nAnte, at 13; see ante, at 16. If by that the Court means\nthat the States may adopt positions adverse to Duke\nEnergy and CRWSP, that surely cannot be enough. The\nguiding principle articulated in New Jersey v. New York is\n\u201cthat the state, when a party to a suit involving a matter\nof sovereign interest, \u2018must be deemed to represent all its\ncitizens,\u2019 \u201d and may not be \u201cjudicially impeached on mat\nters of policy by its own subjects.\u201d 345 U. S., at 372\u2013373\n(quoting Kentucky v. Indiana, 281 U. S., at 173\u2013174). This\ncase involves a \u201cmatter of sovereign interest\u201d\u2014the equita\nble apportionment of water\u2014and the States therefore\n\u201cproperly represen[t]\u201d the shared interests in water of \u201call\u201d\ntheir citizens, including Duke Energy and CRWSP. 345\nU. S., at 372\u2013373. An interest is \u201cnot properly repre\nsented\u201d by a State, id., at 373, when it is not a sovereign\ninterest but instead a parochial one, such as the interests\nheld to justify intervention in the cases on which the\nmajority relies. See supra, at 7\u20138.\n   The majority also pays little heed to the practical con\nstraints on this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It is hard to\n\f12         SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nsee how the arguments the Court accepts today could not\nalso be pressed by countless other water users in either\nNorth or South Carolina. Under the Court\u2019s analysis, I\nsee \u201cno practical limitation on the number of citizens, as\nsuch, who would be entitled to be made parties.\u201d New\nJersey v. New York, supra, at 373. To the extent interven\ntion is allowed for some private entities with interests in\nthe water, others who also have an interest will feel com\npelled to intervene as well\u2014and we will be hard put to\nrefuse them. See Utah v. United States, 394 U. S., at 95\u2013\n96 (denying intervention to a corporation that sought to\nquiet its title to land because, \u201c[i]f [it were] admitted,\nfairness would require the admission of any of the other\n120 private landowners who wish to quiet their title . . . ,\ngreatly increasing the complexity of this litigation\u201d). An\nequitable apportionment action will take on the character\nistics of an interpleader case, with all those asserting\ninterests in the limited supply of water jostling for their\nshare like animals at a water hole. And we will find our\nselves in a \u201cquandary whereby we must opt either to pick\nand choose arbitrarily among similarly situated litigants\nor to devote truly enormous portions of our energies to\n[original] matters.\u201d Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.,\n401 U. S., at 504.\n   Allowing nonsovereign entities to intervene as parties\nwill inevitably prolong the resolution of this and other\nequitable apportionment actions, which already take\nconsiderable time. Intervenors do not come alone\u2014they\nbring along more issues to decide, more discovery re\nquests, more exceptions to the recommendations of the\nSpecial Master. In particular, intervention makes settling\na case more difficult, as a private intervenor has the right\nto object to a settlement agreement between the States, if\nnot the power to block a settlement altogether. Cf. Fire\nfighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 529 (1986).\n   And all this for what? The Special Master, and through\n\f                      Cite as: 558 U.

J.\n\nher the Court, can have the benefit of the views of those\nseeking to intervene by according them the status of amici\ncuriae. \u201cWhere he presents no new questions, a third\nparty can contribute usually most effectively and always\nmost expeditiously by a brief amicus curiae and not by\nintervention.\u201d Bush v. Viterna, 740 F. 2d 350, 359 (CA5\n1984) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nCourts often treat amicus participation as an alternative\nto intervention. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a71913, p. 495, and n. 26\n(2007) (citing examples). And this Court often denies\nmotions to intervene while granting leave to participate as\nan amicus in original actions generally, see, e.g., Kentucky\nv. Indiana, 445 U. S. 941 (1980); United States v. Califor\nnia, 377 U. S. 926 (1964); cf. New Hampshire v. Maine,\n426 U. S. 363, 365, n. 2 (1976), and in equitable appor\ntionment actions specifically, see, e.g., Arizona v. Califor\nnia, 530 U. S. 392, 419, n. 6 (2000); Nebraska v. Wyoming,\n507 U. S. 584, 589\u2013590 (1993).\n   Nebraska v. Wyoming is particularly instructive on this\npoint. The Court there adopted the recommendation of\nthe Special Master to deny intervention to certain entities.\nSee id., at 589\u2013590; Second Interim Report of Special\nMaster, O. T. 1991, No. 108, Orig., pp. 108\u2013109. The\ninterests of those entities in the water dispute were quite\nsimilar to the interests of the entities seeking to intervene\nhere: One operated a powerplant and a reservoir on the\nLaramie River, and another was a power district seeking\nto protect its FERC license. See First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master, O. T. 1988, No. 108, Orig., pp. 11\u201314, 9a.\nWhile it adopted the Special Master\u2019s recommendation to\ndeny intervention, the Court nonetheless permitted those\nentities to participate as amici. See 507 U. S., at 589\u2013590;\nNebraska v. Wyoming, 502 U. S. 1055 (1992).2 The major\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 No   party filed exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s recommendation to\n\f14           SOUTH CAROLINA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nity does not explain why that familiar and customary\napproach might be inadequate in this case.\n                           *     *      *\n   Our original jurisdiction over actions between States is\nconcerned with disputes so serious that they would be\ngrounds for war if the States were truly sovereign. Texas\nv. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 571, n. 18. A dispute between\nStates over rights to water fits that bill; a squabble among\nprivate entities within a State over how to divvy up that\nState\u2019s share does not. A judgment in an equitable appor\ntionment action binds the States; it is not binding with\nrespect to particular uses asserted by private entities.\nAllowing intervention by such entities would vastly com\nplicate and delay already complicated and lengthy actions.\nAnd the benefits private entities might bring can be read\nily secured, as has typically been done, by their participa\ntion as amici curiae.\n   In light of all this, it is difficult to understand why the\nCourt grants nonsovereign entities leave to intervene in\nthis equitable apportionment action, and easy to under\nstand why the Court has never before done so in such a\ncase.\n   I would grant South Carolina\u2019s exceptions, and deny the\nmotions to intervene.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndeny intervention in Nebraska v.

Argued November 10, 2009\u2014Decided January 20, 2010\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n  1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or\n  Act), codifying certain rules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney Gen\n  eral, that govern the process of reopening removal proceedings.\n  IIRIRA also added a provision stating that no court has jurisdiction\n  to review any action of the Attorney General \u201cthe authority for which\n  is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor\n  ney General.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii). A regulation, amended\n  just months before IIRIRA\u2019s enactment, provides that \u201c[t]he decision\n  to grant or deny a motion to reopen . . . is within the discretion of the\n  [Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)],\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a). As adjudi\n  cator in immigration cases, the BIA exercises authority delegated by\n  the Attorney General.\n     Petitioner Kucana moved to reopen his removal proceedings, as\n  serting new evidence in support of his plea for asylum. An Immigra\n  tion Judge denied the motion, and the BIA sustained that ruling.\n  The Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review\n  the administrative determination, holding that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars\n  judicial review not only of administrative decisions made discretion\n  ary by statute, but also of those made discretionary by regulation.\nHeld: Section 1252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s proscription of judicial review applies only\n to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute,\n not to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General\n himself through regulation. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) The motion to reopen is an \u201cimportant safeguard\u201d intended \u201cto\n ensure a proper and lawful disposition\u201d of immigration proceedings.\n Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___. Federal-court review of adminis\n trative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings\n\f2                          KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    dates back to at least 1916, with the courts employing a deferential\n    abuse-of-discretion standard of review. While the Attorney General\u2019s\n    regulation in point, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), places the reopening decision\n    within the BIA\u2019s discretion, the statute does not codify that prescrip\n    tion or otherwise \u201cspecif[y]\u201d that such decisions are in the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretion. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Section 1252(a)(2)(B) does not proscribe judicial review of deni\n    als of motions to reopen. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (1) The amicus defending the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment urges\n    that regulations suffice to trigger \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proscription.\n    She comprehends \u201cunder\u201d in \u201cauthority . . . specified under this sub\n    chapter\u201d to mean, e.g., \u201cpursuant to,\u201d \u201csubordinate to.\u201d Administra\n    tive regulations count for \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) purposes, she submits, be\n    cause they are issued \u201cpursuant to,\u201d and are measures \u201csubordinate\n    to,\u201d the legislation they serve to implement. On that reading,\n    \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would bar judicial review of any decision that an\n    executive regulation places within the BIA\u2019s discretion, including the\n    decision to deny a motion to reopen. The parties, on the other hand,\n    read the statutory language to mean \u201cspecified in,\u201d or \u201cspecified by,\u201d\n    the subchapter. On their reading, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judi\n    cial review only when the statute itself specifies the discretionary\n    character of the Attorney General\u2019s authority. Pp. 8\u20139.\n         (2) The word \u201cunder\u201d \u201chas many dictionary definitions and must\n    draw its meaning from its context.\u201d Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129,\n    135. Examining the provision at issue in statutory context, the par\n    ties\u2019 position stands on firmer ground. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is far\n    from IIRIRA\u2019s only jurisdictional limitation. It is sandwiched be\n    tween two subsections, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C), both de\n    pendent on statutory provisions, not on any regulation, to define\n    their scope. Given \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, one would\n    expect that it, too, would cover statutory provisions alone. Pp. 9\u201311.\n         (3) Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) places within the no-judicial-review\n    category \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n    1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the referenced\n    statutory provisions addresses a different form of discretionary relief\n    from removal and contains language indicating that the decision is\n    entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. Clause (i) does not re\n    fer to any regulatory provision. The proximity of clause (i) and the\n    clause (ii) catchall, and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other deci\n    sion\u201d\u2014suggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\n    genre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation. Read harmoni\n    ously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court review of dis\n    cretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney\n    General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute. Pp. 11\u201312.\n\f                   Cite as: 558 U.

The listed determinations\nare substantive decisions the Executive makes involving whether or\nnot aliens can stay in the country. Other decisions specified by stat\nute \u201cto be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d and therefore\nshielded from court oversight by \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71157(c)(1). Decisions on reopening motions made discre\ntionary by regulation, in contrast, are adjunct rulings. A court deci\nsion reversing the denial of a motion to reopen does not direct the\nExecutive to afford the alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches\nand concerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have been\naccorded a reasonable hearing. Had Congress wanted the jurisdic\ntional bar to encompass decisions specified as discretionary by regu\nlation as well as by statute, moreover, Congress could easily have\nsaid so, as it did in provisions enacted simultaneously with\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See, e.g., IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013572.\nPp. 12\u201314.\n      (5) The history of the relevant statutory provisions corroborates\nthis determination. Attorney General regulations have long ad\ndressed reopening requests. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress simulta\nneously codified the process for filing motions to reopen and acted to\nbar judicial review of a number of executive decisions regarding re\nmoval. But Congress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny reopening motions. This legislative\nsilence indicates that Congress left the matter where it was pre-\nIIRIRA: The BIA has broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney\nGeneral, \u201cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), but\ncourts retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. It is unsur\nprising that Congress would leave in place judicial oversight of this\n\u201cimportant [procedural] safeguard,\u201d Dada, 554 U. S., at ___, where,\nas here, the alien\u2019s underlying asylum claim would itself be review\nable. The REAL ID Act of 2005, which further amended the INA by\nadding or reformulating provisions on asylum, protection from re\nmoval, and even judicial review, did not disturb the unbroken line of\ndecisions upholding court review of administrative denials of motions\nto reopen. Pp. 14\u201316.\n   (c) Any lingering doubt about \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proper interpreta\ntion would be dispelled by a familiar statutory construction principle:\nthe presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.\nWhen a statute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion,\u201d this Court adopts the reading \u201cthat executive determinations\ngenerally are subject to judicial review.\u201d Gutierrez de Martinez v.\nLamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434. The Court has consistently applied\nthis interpretive guide to legislation regarding immigration, and par\n\f4                          KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ticularly to questions concerning the preservation of federal-court ju\n    risdiction. See, e.g., Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.\n    43, 63\u201364. Because this presumption is \u201c \u2018well-settled,\u2019 \u201d ibid., the\n    Court assumes that \u201cCongress legislates with knowledge of\u201d it,\n    McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 496. It there\n    fore takes \u201c \u2018 \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d \u2019 \u201d to dislodge the pre\n    sumption. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 64. There is no\n    such evidence here. Finally, reading \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to\n    matters where discretion is conferred on the BIA by regulation would\n    ignore Congress\u2019 design to retain for itself control over federal-court\n    jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s construction would free the Ex\n    ecutive to shelter its own decisions from abuse-of-discretion appellate\n    court review simply by issuing a regulation declaring those decisions\n    \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\n    not be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) sus\ntained the IJ\u2019s ruling, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\nreview the administrative determination. For that conclu\nsion, the court relied on a provision added to the Immigra\ntion and Nationality Act (INA or Act), 66 Stat. 166, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., by the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110\nStat. 3009\u2013546. The provision found dispositive by the\nSeventh Circuit, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), states that no\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review any action of the\nAttorney General \u201cthe authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attor\nney General,\u201d \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the proscription\nof judicial review stated in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) applies not only\nto Attorney General determinations made discretionary by\n\f2                   KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, but also to determinations declared discretionary\nby the Attorney General himself through regulation. We\nhold that the key words \u201cspecified under this subchapter\u201d\nrefer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications. We\nso rule based on the longstanding exercise of judicial\nreview of administrative rulings on reopening motions, the\ntext and context of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), and the history of the\nrelevant statutory provisions. We take account, as well, of\nthe \u201cpresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to]\nallow judicial review of administrative action.\u201d Reno v.\nCatholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 63\u201364 (1993)\n(quoting McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.\n479, 496 (1991)). Separation-of-powers concerns, more\nover, caution us against reading legislation, absent clear\nstatement, to place in executive hands authority to remove\ncases from the Judiciary\u2019s domain.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n  In IIRIRA, Congress for the first time codified certain\nrules, earlier prescribed by the Attorney General, govern\ning the reopening process. The amended Act instructs\nthat reopening motions \u201cshall state the new facts that will\nbe proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,\nand shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary\nmaterial.\u201d \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B). Congress also prescribed that\n\u201cthe motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the\ndate of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d\n\u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Among matters excepted from the 90\nday limitation are motions to reopen asylum applications\nbecause of changed conditions in the country of nationality\nor removal. \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).\n  Section 1252(a)(2), captioned \u201cMatters not subject to\njudicial review,\u201d contains the provision on which this case\nturns. Subparagraph (B) of that paragraph, headed \u201cDe\nnials of discretionary relief,\u201d states:\n\f                      Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(D) in 2005 did not change the\noperative language of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as enacted in 1996.\n   The REAL ID Act amendments also inserted into this introductory\nclause, inter alia, the words \u201c(statutory or nonstatutory).\u201d\n\u00a7106(a)(1)(A)(ii), 119 Stat. 310. The introductory clause, however, does\nnot define the scope of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar.\nIt simply informs that once the scope of the bar is determined, jurisdic\ntion is precluded regardless of what any other provision or source of law\nmight say.\n   2 Sections 1182(h) and 1182(i) address waivers of inadmissibility\n\nbased on certain criminal offenses, and fraud or misrepresentation,\nrespectively; \u00a71229b addresses cancellation of removal; \u00a71229c, volun\ntary departure; and \u00a71255, adjustment of status.\n   3 \u201c[T]his subchapter\u201d refers to Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, of\n\nthe United States Code, codified at 8 U.

HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nA regulation, amended in 1996, just months before Con\ngress enacted IIRIRA, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904, Pt. 3, \u00a73.2(a),\nstates that \u201c[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to\nreopen . . . is within the discretion of the Board.\u201d 8 CFR\n\u00a71003.2(a) (2009). As adjudicator in immigration cases,\nthe Board exercises authority delegated by the Attorney\nGeneral. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(g)(2); 8 CFR \u00a71003.1. See\nalso 8 CFR \u00a71003.23(b)(3) (governing motions to reopen\nfiled with an IJ).\n                               B\n  Kucana, a citizen of Albania, entered the United States\non a business visa in 1995 and remained after the visa\nexpired. Alleging that he would be persecuted based on\nhis political beliefs if returned to Albania, Kucana applied\nfor asylum and withholding of removal in 1996. An IJ\ndetermined that Kucana was removable and scheduled a\nhearing to evaluate his eligibility for asylum. When Ku\ncana failed to appear for the hearing, the IJ immediately\nordered his removal in absentia. Kucana filed a motion to\nreopen, explaining that he had missed his hearing because\nhe had overslept. The IJ denied the motion, and the BIA\naffirmed in 2002. Kucana did not seek judicial review, nor\ndid he leave the United States.\n  Kucana filed a second motion to reopen his removal\nproceedings in 2006, contending that conditions in Albania\nhad worsened.5 The BIA denied relief; it concluded that\nconditions in Albania had actually improved since 1997.\nArguing that the BIA had abused its discretion in denying\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlimited to the denial of his motion to reopen; he does not challenge in\nthis proceeding the decision denying his application for asylum.\n  5 The statute \u201cguarantees to each alien the right to file \u2018one motion to\n\nreopen proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op.,\nat 12) (quoting \u00a71229a(c)(7)(A)).

Kucana v. Mukasey,\n533 F. 3d 534, 539 (2008). The court held that 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars judicial review not only of adminis\ntrative decisions made discretionary by statute, but also\n\u201cwhen the agency\u2019s discretion is specified by a regulation\nrather than a statute.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536.6 In so ruling,\nthe Seventh Circuit created a split between itself and\nother Courts of Appeals, all of them holding that denials of\nreopening motions are reviewable in court.7\n  Judge Ripple concurred dubitante. He acknowledged\nthat the court was following an earlier decision, Ali v.\nGonzales, 502 F. 3d 659 (CA7 2007),8 but \u201csuggest[ed]\nthat, had Congress intended to deprive th[e] court of juris\ndiction . . . , it would have done so explicitly, as it did in 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i).\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 540. The court,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 While recognizing that a regulation, rather than the INA itself,\n\nconfers on the Board discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen, the\nCourt of Appeals said that the regulation, \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] . . . force\nfrom provisions in the Act allowing immigration officials to govern their\nown proceedings.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536. The \u201cforce,\u201d according to the\nSeventh Circuit, comes from 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), which it described\nas providing \u201cauthority for reopening by [the] Board.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at\n536. Section 1229a(c)(7), however, is not directed to the agency\u2019s\ndiscretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. In the main, \u201cit simply\nlays out the requirements an alien must fulfill when filing a motion to\nreopen.\u201d Id., at 541 (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See\nalso infra, at 7, n. 9.\n   7 See Singh v. Mukasey, 536 F. 3d 149, 153\u2013154 (CA2 2008); Jahjaga\n\nv.

HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhe concluded, should revisit both Ali and Kucana and\n\u201cchart a course . . . more closely adher[ing] to the statutory\nlanguage chosen and enacted by Congress.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at\n540.\n   Judge Cudahy dissented. Given the absence of \u201cspecific\n[statutory] language entrusting the decision on a motion\nto reopen to the discretion of the Attorney General,\u201d ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted), he saw no impediment\nto the exercise of jurisdiction over Kucana\u2019s petition. In\nsupport of his position, Judge Cudahy invoked the \u201cstrong\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review of\nadministrative action.\u201d Id., at 541 (quoting Traynor v.\nTurnage, 485 U. S. 535, 542 (1988)). With four judges\ndissenting, the Seventh Circuit denied Kucana\u2019s petition\nfor rehearing en banc. See 533 F. 3d, at 541\u2013542 (dissent\ning statement of Ripple, J., joined by Rovner, Wood, and\nWilliams, JJ.).\n   We granted certiorari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to re-\nsolve the Circuit conflict. As it did before the Seventh\nCircuit, the Government agrees with Kucana that\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not remove federal-court jurisdic\ntion to review the denial of a reopening motion. We ap\npointed Amanda C. Leiter to brief and argue the case, as\namicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judg\nment. 557 U. S. ___ (2009). Ms. Leiter has ably dis\ncharged her assigned responsibilities.\n                             II\n  The motion to reopen is an \u201cimportant safeguard\u201d in\ntended \u201cto ensure a proper and lawful disposition\u201d of\nimmigration proceedings.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310) (citing\ncases). This Court has ultimately reviewed reopening\ndecisions on numerous occasions. See, e.g., INS v. Do\nherty, 502 U. S. 314, 322\u2013324 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485\nU. S. 94, 104\u2013111 (1988); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U. S.\n444, 449\u2013452 (1985); INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U. S. 139,\n141\u2013146 (1981) (per curiam). Mindful of the Board\u2019s\n\u201cbroad discretion\u201d in such matters, however, courts have\nemployed a deferential, abuse-of-discretion standard of\nreview. See Doherty, 502 U. S., at 323 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n    The Seventh Circuit held that Congress removed the\nauthority long exercised by federal courts to review deni\nals of an alien\u2019s reopening request. Congress did so, the\nCourt of Appeals said, in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which removes\njurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General\n\u201cthe authority for which is specified under this subchapter\nto be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d All agree\nthat the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a),\nplaces \u201c[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen\n. . . within the discretion of the Board.\u201d But the statute\ndoes not codify that prescription,9 and does not otherwise\n\u201cspecif[y]\u201d that reopening decisions are \u201cin the discretion\nof the Attorney General.\u201d10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 As earlier noted, see supra, at 5, n. 6, the Seventh Circuit stated\n\nthat the regulation specifying the Board\u2019s discretion over motions to\nreopen, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), \u201cdraw[s] [its] force from provisions in the\nAct.\u201d 533 F. 3d, at 536 (citing 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7)). It is hard to see\nhow the regulation could draw force from \u00a71229a(c)(7), for the regula\ntion was already in force when that statutory provision was enacted.\nThe regulation, 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a), was published April 29, 1996, 61\nFed. Reg. 18900, 18904; 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7) was enacted September\n30, 1996, \u00a7304, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013593.\n   10 The only statutory reference to discretion respecting motions to\n\nreopen appears in \u00a71229a(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III), which gives the Attorney\nGeneral \u201cdiscretion\u201d to waive one of the statute\u2019s time limitations in\n\f8                         KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n                                A\n                                1\n  The Board\u2019s discretionary authority to act on a motion to\nreopen, we have thus far explained, is \u201cspecified\u201d not in a\nstatute, but only in the Attorney General\u2019s regulation,\nwhich instructs: \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to\nreopen . . . is within the discretion of the Board, subject to\nthe restrictions of this section. The Board has discretion\nto deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has\nmade out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a).\nNevertheless, in defense of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judg\nment, amicus urges that regulations suffice to trigger 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s proscription of judicial review.\n  The jurisdiction-stripping provision, amicus reminds,\nrefers to \u201cauthority . . . specified under this subchapter.\u201d\nAs she reads that formulation, the word \u201cunder\u201d is key.\nShe comprehends \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cpursuant to,\u201d \u201csubor\ndinate to,\u201d \u201cbelow or lower than,\u201d \u201cinferior . . . in rank or\nimportance,\u201d \u201cby reason of the authority of.\u201d Brief for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nextraordinary circumstances.\n   Amicus urges that \u201cthe statutory language governing motions to\nreopen anticipates an exercise of Attorney General discretion when it\nstates, \u2018[t]he motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be\nproven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nCourt-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 19, n. 8\n(quoting \u00a71229a(c)(7)(B)). One can demur to the argument that Con\ngress anticipated that decisions on reopening motions would be discre\ntionary.     Even so, the statutory proscription Congress enacted,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), speaks of authority \u201cspecified\u201d\u2014not merely assumed\nor contemplated\u2014to be in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. \u201cSpeci\nfied\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cimplied\u201d or \u201canticipated.\u201d See Webster\u2019s\nNew Collegiate Dictionary 1116 (1974) (\u201cspecify\u201d means \u201cto name or\nstate explicitly or in detail\u201d).

On the parties\u2019\nreading, however, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial\nreview only when the statute itself specifies the discre\ntionary character of the Attorney General\u2019s authority.\n                             2\n  As the parties and amicus recognize, their diverse ren\nderings of \u201cunder,\u201d standing alone, do not equip us to\nresolve this case.

In every one of those examples, Congress\nexpressly used the word \u201cregulations.\u201d\n  At oral argument, amicus called our attention to three instances in\nwhich Congress used the words \u201cspecified under\u201d in Title 8, without any\nreference to \u201cregulations,\u201d to encompass agency matters.

HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning, in statutory context, the provision in which the word\n\u201cunder\u201d is embedded, we conclude that the parties\u2019 posi\ntion stands on firmer ground.\n   Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), the provision at issue here, is\nfar from the only jurisdictional limitation in IIRIRA. See\nDada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Davis v. Michigan Dept. of\nTreasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989) (\u201c[T]he words of a\nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to\ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d). Section\n1252(a)(2), titled \u201cMatters not subject to judicial review,\u201d\nlists a variety of agency determinations the federal courts\nlack jurisdiction to review. Those determinations divide\ninto three categories. The first, \u00a71252(a)(2)(A), concerns\nimmigration officers\u2019 determinations whether aliens apply\ning for admission are admissible. Next in statutory order\nis the provision before us, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), which involves\ndenials of discretionary relief.        The last category,\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(C), concerns final orders of removal entered\nagainst criminal aliens.\n   Both \u00a71252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a71252(a)(2)(C) depend on statu\ntory provisions, not on any regulation, to define their\nscope. The latter provision, the criminal alien bar, pre\ncludes judicial review of \u201cany final order of removal\nagainst an alien who is removable by reason of having\ncommitted a criminal offense covered in\u201d \u00a71182(a)(2),\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D), or certain offenses\ncovered in \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(ii).

The same holds\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nArg. 47\u201348, 54\u201355 (citing \u00a7\u00a71227(a)(1)(H), 1375a(a)(6), and 1537(b)(1)).\n\nThese three provisions point to other parts of the Act, which in turn\n\nrely on administrative determinations.

Given\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s statutory placement, sandwiched between\nsubsections (a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(C), one would expect that\nit, too, would cover statutory provisions alone.\n                              3\n   Focusing on \u00a71252(a)(2)(B), we note the lead line serving\nto introduce both of the subparagraph\u2019s two clauses: \u201c[N]o\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review . . . .\u201d Clause (i)\nthen places within the no-judicial-review category \u201cany\njudgment regarding the granting of relief under section\n1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255.\u201d Each of the\nstatutory provisions referenced in clause (i) addresses a\ndifferent form of discretionary relief from removal, see\nsupra, at 3, n. 2, and each contains language indicating\nthat the decision is entrusted to the Attorney General\u2019s\ndiscretion. See, e.g., \u00a71182(h) (\u201cThe Attorney General\nmay, in his discretion, waive [inadmissibility based on\ncertain criminal offenses].\u201d). Clause (i) does not refer to\nany regulatory provision.\n   To the clause (i) enumeration of administrative judg\nments that are insulated from judicial review, Congress\nadded in clause (ii) a catchall provision covering \u201cany\nother decision . . . the authority for which is specified\nunder this subchapter.\u201d The proximity of clauses (i) and\n(ii), and the words linking them\u2014\u201cany other decision\u201d\u2014\nsuggests that Congress had in mind decisions of the same\ngenre, i.e., those made discretionary by legislation.13 The\nclause (i) enumeration, we find, is instructive in determin\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    13 Congress excepted from \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \u201cthe granting of relief\n\nunder [\u00a7]1158(a).\u201d Section 1158 concerns applications for asylum.\nAbsent the exception, asylum applicants might fall within\n\u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar because a statutory provision,\n\u00a71158(b)(1)(A), specifies that \u201cthe Attorney General may grant asylum.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.)

Read harmoni\nously, both clauses convey that Congress barred court\nreview of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself\nset out the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority in\nthe statute. See Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel,\nInc., 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[W]hen a\nstatute sets out a series of specific items ending with a\ngeneral term, that general term is confined to covering\nsubjects comparable to the specifics it follows.\u201d).14\n                             4\n  We also find significant the character of the decisions\nCongress enumerated in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(i), thereby insulat\ning them from judicial review. As the Government ex\nplained at oral argument, the determinations there listed\nare \u201csubstantive decisions . . . made by the Executive in\nthe immigration context as a matter of grace, things that\ninvolve whether aliens can stay in the country or not.\u201d Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 14.15 They include waivers of inadmissibility\nbased on certain criminal offenses, \u00a71182(h), or based on\nfraud or misrepresentation, \u00a71182(i); cancellation of re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Amicus suggests that the word \u201cany\u201d in \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) should be\n\nread expansively to draw in decisions made discretionary by regulation.\nBrief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment\nBelow 21\u201323. But \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not say \u201cany decision\u201d; it says\n\u201cany other decision.\u201d And as we have just explained, other decisions\nfalling within \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s compass are most sensibly understood\nto include only decisions made discretionary by Congress. See Brief for\nRespondent 19\u201320, and n. 11 (noting that \u201cover thirty provisions in the\nrelevant subchapter of the INA . . . explicitly grant the Attorney Gen\neral . . . \u2018discretion\u2019 to make a certain decision\u201d).\n  15 Counsel offered this explanation in response to the question: \u201cWhy\n\nwould Congress want to exclude review for discretionary judgments by\nthe Attorney General that are recited explicitly to be discretionary in\nthe statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that are just as\nlawfully discretionary because the Attorney General is given the\nauthority to make them discretionary and has done so?\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 9; see id., at 13\u201314.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoval, \u00a71229b; permission for voluntary departure,\n\u00a71229c; and adjustment of status, \u00a71255.\n   Other decisions specified by statute \u201cto be in the discre\ntion of the Attorney General,\u201d and therefore shielded from\ncourt oversight by \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind.\nSee, e.g., \u00a71157(c)(1) (discretion to admit refugees \u201cdeter\nmined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United\nStates\u201d); \u00a71181(b) (discretion to waive requirement of\ndocumentation for readmission); \u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(iv) (discre\ntion to waive, in certain cases, inadmissibility of aliens\nwho have affiliated with a totalitarian party). Decisions\non reopening motions made discretionary by regulation, in\ncontrast, are adjunct rulings: The motion to reopen is a\nprocedural device serving to ensure \u201cthat aliens [a]re\ngetting a fair chance to have their claims heard.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 17. A court decision reversing the denial of a\nmotion to reopen does not direct the Executive to afford\nthe alien substantive relief; ordinarily, it touches and\nconcerns only the question whether the alien\u2019s claims have\nbeen accorded a reasonable hearing.\n   If Congress wanted the jurisdictional bar to encompass\ndecisions specified as discretionary by regulation along\nwith those made discretionary by statute, moreover, Con\ngress could easily have said so. In other provisions en\nacted simultaneously with \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress\nexpressed precisely that meaning. See IIRIRA, \u00a7213, 110\nStat. 3009\u2013572 (\u201cimmigration benefits pursuant to this\nAct; or the regulations promulgated thereunder\u201d), codified\nat 8 U. S.

S. C. \u00a71103(a)(10). \u201c[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d Nken v. Holder,\n\f14                   KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 11) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n                              B\n   The history of the relevant statutory provisions corrobo\nrates our determination that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not\nproscribe judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.\nAttorney General regulations have long addressed reopen\ning requests. See 6 Fed. Reg. 71\u201372 (1941). The current\nregulations, adopted in 1996, 61 Fed. Reg. 18904\u201318906,\nderive from rules published in 1958, see 23 Fed. Reg.\n9118\u20139119; Dada, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   Enacting IIRIRA in 1996, Congress \u201ctransform[ed] the\nmotion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statu\ntory form of relief available to the alien.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). IIRIRA largely codified the Attorney General\u2019s\ndirections on filing reopening motions. See \u00a71229a(c)(7)\n(guaranteeing right to file one motion, prescribing con\ntents, and setting deadlines).\n   In the same legislation, Congress amended the INA\naggressively to expedite removal of aliens lacking a legal\nbasis to remain in the United States. See Reno v. Ameri\ncan-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475\n(1999). Among IIRIRA\u2019s several proscriptions of judicial\nreview is the one here at issue, \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), barring\nreview of administrative decisions Congress placed within\nthe Attorney General\u2019s discretion.\n   Congress thus simultaneously codified the process for\nfiling motions to reopen and acted to bar judicial review of\na number of executive decisions regarding removal. But\nCongress did not codify the regulation delegating to the\nBIA discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen. See 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (reopening may be entertained not only on\napplication; Board \u201cmay at any time reopen . . . on its own\nmotion any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d).\nHad Congress elected to insulate denials of motions to\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nreopen from judicial review, it could have so specified\ntogether with its codification of directions on filing reopen\ning motions.\n  From the Legislature\u2019s silence on the discretion of the\nAttorney General (or his delegate, the Board) over reopen\ning motions, see supra, at 7\u20138, n. 10, we take it that Con\ngress left the matter where it was pre-IIRIRA: The BIA\nhas broad discretion, conferred by the Attorney General,\n\u201cto grant or deny a motion to reopen,\u201d 8 CFR \u00a71003.2(a),\nbut courts retain jurisdiction to review, with due respect,\nthe Board\u2019s decision.16 It is unsurprising that Congress\nwould leave in place judicial oversight of this \u201cimportant\n[procedural] safeguard\u201d designed \u201cto ensure a proper and\nlawful disposition\u201d of immigration proceedings, Dada, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316), where, as here, the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim (for asylum) would itself be reviewable.17\n  In the REAL ID Act, Congress further amended the\nINA. By 2005, two Courts of Appeals had already ruled\nthat 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude them\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 A statement in the House Conference Report on IIRIRA, amicus\n\nsuggests, supports her argument that Congress intended broadly to\nforeclose judicial review of reopening denials.        Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 32\u201334. The\nreport states that \u00a71252(a)(2)(B) \u201cbars judicial review . . . of any deci\nsion or action of the Attorney General which is specified to be in the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General.\u201d H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\u2013828,\np. 219 (1996). That statement, as we read it, simply summarizes the\nstatutory text at a general level. It does not home in on the question\nwhether decisions made discretionary only by regulation are judicially\nreviewable.\n   17 We do not reach the question whether review of a reopening denial\n\nwould be precluded if the court would lack jurisdiction over the alien\u2019s\nunderlying claim for relief. Some courts confronting that question have\nrefused to consider petitions for review of a reopening denial that seeks\nto revisit the denial of the underlying claim; they have reasoned that\nhearing the petition would end-run the bar to review of the petitioner\u2019s\ncore claim. See, e.g., Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F. 3d 471, 473\u2013475 (CA5\n2004) (per curiam).\n\f16                     KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom reviewing denials of motions to reopen, see Infanzon\nv. Ashcroft, 386 F. 3d 1359, 1361\u20131362 (CA10 2004); Me\ndina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F. 3d 520, 528\u2013529 (CA9\n2004), and no court had reached a contrary result. Al\nthough adding or reformulating provisions on asylum,\n\u00a7101(a), (b), 119 Stat. 302\u2013303, protection from removal,\n\u00a7101(c), (d), id., at 303\u2013305, even judicial review, \u00a7106, id.,\nat 310\u2013311, the REAL ID Act did not disturb the unbroken\nline of decisions upholding court review of administrative\ndenials of motions to reopen. See supra, at 6\u20137; supra, at\n3, n. 1.18\n                              IV\n   Any lingering doubt about the proper interpretation of 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be dispelled by a familiar\nprinciple of statutory construction: the presumption favor\ning judicial review of administrative action. When a\nstatute is \u201creasonably susceptible to divergent interpreta\ntion, we adopt the reading that accords with traditional\nunderstandings and basic principles: that executive de\nterminations generally are subject to judicial review.\u201d\nGutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 434\n(1995). We have consistently applied that interpretive\nguide to legislation regarding immigration, and particu\nlarly to questions concerning the preservation of federal\ncourt jurisdiction. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,\n298 (2001); Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S., at 63\u2013\n64; McNary, 498 U. S., at 496.

Courts\nof Appeals have held that such decisions are unreviewable because\nsua sponte reopening is committed to agency discretion by law, see 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7701(a)(2). See, e.g., Tamenut v. Mukasey, 521 F. 3d 1000,\n1003\u20131004 (CA8 2008) (en banc) (per curiam) (agreeing with ten other\nCourts of Appeals).\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 63\u201364 (quoting McNary,\n498 U.

Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509\nU. S., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is\nno such evidence here.\n  Finally, we stress a paramount factor in the decision we\nrender today. By defining the various jurisdictional bars\nby reference to other provisions in the INA itself, Congress\nensured that it, and only it, would limit the federal courts\u2019\njurisdiction. To read \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply to matters\nwhere discretion is conferred on the Board by regulation,\nrather than on the Attorney General by statute, would\nignore that congressional design. If the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nconstruction of \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii) were to prevail, the Ex\necutive would have a free hand to shelter its own decisions\nfrom abuse-of-discretion appellate court review simply by\nissuing a regulation declaring those decisions \u201cdiscretion\nary.\u201d Such an extraordinary delegation of authority can\nnot be extracted from the statute Congress enacted.\n                               V\n  A statute affecting federal jurisdiction \u201cmust be con\nstrued both with precision and with fidelity to the terms\nby which Congress has expressed its wishes.\u201d Cheng Fan\nKwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968). As we have noted,\nsee supra, at 14, and as amicus emphasizes, \u201cmany provi\nsions of IIRIRA [we]re aimed at protecting [from court\nreview exercises of] the Executive\u2019s discretion.\u201d American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.

HOLDER,\n          JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                        [January 20, 2010]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to\nreview the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen his\nremoval proceeding, but I would decide this case on nar\nrower grounds. The controlling statutory provision, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71252(a)(2)(B)(ii), states that \u201cno court shall have\njurisdiction to review . . . any . . . decision . . . of the Attor\nney General . . . the authority for which is specified under\nthis subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cunder this\nsubchapter\u201d refers to Subchapter II of Chapter 12 of Title\n8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71151\u20131381, see ante, at 3, n. 3, and, as the\nCourt notes, no provision of Subchapter II confers discre\ntionary authority on the Attorney General to decide mo\ntions to reopen. See ante, at 7\u20138, 14\u201315. The Court of\nAppeals, however, held that the Attorney General\u2019s deci\nsion in this case was unreviewable because a regulation, 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2(a) (2009), made that decision discretionary.\n   If this regulation had been promulgated pursuant to\nauthority conferred by a provision of Subchapter II, we\nwould have to confront the question that the opinion of the\nCourt addresses. But it seems clear that 8 CFR \u00a71003.2,\nat least insofar as it gave the Attorney General the discre\ntionary authority that he exercised in this case, is\ngrounded on authority conferred under Subchapter I of\n\f2                        KUCANA v. HOLDER\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nChapter 12 of Title 8, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71101\u20131107. See 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71103(a) (1994 ed.) (giving the Attorney General\nthe authority to \u201cestablish such regulations . . . as he\ndeems necessary for carrying out his authority under\n[Chapter 12 of Title 8 of the U. S. Code]\u201d).\n   The amicus curiae whom we appointed to defend the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals has attempted to link 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2 to Subchapter II. She notes that the Attor\nney General, in promulgating that regulation, cited not\nonly 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a), but also a provision of Subchapter\nII, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b (1994 ed.). See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900,\n18904 (1996).1 This latter statutory provision2 conferred\nthe authority to reopen a narrow set of deportation orders,\ni.e., those issued after the alien failed to appear at the\ndeportation hearing. Although this statutory provision\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Two other provisions in Subchapter II refer to motions to reopen,\nbut both were enacted after the implementation of 8 CFR \u00a71003.2\n(2009), and therefore that regulation cannot be said to implement these\nprovisions. See ante 7, n. 9. Title 8 U. S. C. \u00a71229a(c)(7), which ad\ndresses the procedural requirements for filing such a motion, and\n\u00a71252(b)(6), which requires consolidation of a motion to reopen with the\nunderlying removal order, were enacted as part of the Illegal Immigra\ntion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) in\nSeptember 1996 and made effective in April 1997. See 110 Stat. 3009\u2013\n593, 3009\u2013609. Prior to that time, the consolidation provision was\nfound in Subchapter I. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71105(a)(6) (1994 ed.).\n   2 This provision conferred the authority to rescind a deportation order\n\n\u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the\norder of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear\nwas because of exceptional circumstances . . . or upon a motion to\nreopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not\nreceive notice . . . or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in\nFederal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the\nalien.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b(c)(3) (1994 ed.).\n   A similar provision, enacted as part of IIRIRA, is now contained in 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71229a(b)(5)(C) (2006 ed.). As the Government notes, this\nprovision does not apply in this case because petitioner challenges the\ndenial of his second motion to reopen, which the parties agree is gov\nerned by \u00a71229a(c)(7).

At most, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71252b (1994 ed.) may be read\nas implicitly authorizing the promulgation of a regulation\ngiving the Attorney General the discretion to reopen cer\ntain deportation orders that were issued in absentia.\nPetitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen, however, seeks re\nopening on grounds outside of \u00a71252b, and therefore 8\nCFR \u00a71003.2, insofar as it applies to petitioner\u2019s case, was\nnot issued pursuant to Subchapter II and does not imple\nment any provision of that Subchapter.\n   For these reasons, this case can and should be decided\non the narrow ground that, even if some regulations can\nrender a decision of the Attorney General unreviewable,\nthe regulation at issue in this case does not have that\neffect.\n\f"}

No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.\n     For many years, New England\u2019s supply of electricity capacity was\n  barely sufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New Eng\n  land\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made\n  several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the\n  latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com\n  prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab\n  lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro\n  vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern\n  rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre\n  sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public\n  interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir\n  cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC\u2019s approval\n  order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate\n  is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra\u2019s public in\n  terest standard does not apply.\nHeld: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of\n the complainant who seeks FERC investigation. The presumption is\n not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting par\n\f2           NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                        UTIL.

Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but\n    its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s holding mis\n    perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc\n    trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals\u2019 disposi\n    tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra\u2019s\n    instruction to FERC to \u201cpresume that the rate set out in a freely ne\n    gotiated . . . contract meets the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 requirement\u201d\n    unless \u201cFERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public\n    interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it\n    unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the\n    D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,\n    the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard. Rather, the public interest stan\n    dard defines \u201cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and\n    reasonable standard in the contract context.\u201d Id., at ___. And if\n    FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result\n    ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may\n    not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine\n    does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con\n    tract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming public.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n    ___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit\u2019s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate\n    challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine\u2019s animating\n    purpose: promotion of \u201cthe stability of supply arrangements which all\n    agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.\u201d Mobile, 350\n    U.

A presumption applicable to contracting parties only,\n    and inoperative as to everyone else\u2014consumers, advocacy groups,\n    state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriae\u2014\n    could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.\n    Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) Whether the rates at issue qualify as \u201ccontract rates\u201d for Mo\n    bile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to\n    treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled\n    upon by, the D.

In 2006,\nafter several attempts by the Commission and concerned\nparties to address the problems, FERC approved a com\u00ad\nprehensive settlement agreement (hereinafter Settlement\nAgreement or Agreement).

For many\nyears in New England, the supply of capacity was barely\nsufficient to meet the region\u2019s demand. FERC and New\nEngland\u2019s generators, electricity providers, and power\ncustomers made several attempts to address this problem.\nThis case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.\n  In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into\n\u201creliability must-run\u201d agreements with the New England\nIndependent System Operator (ISO), which operates the\nregion\u2019s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing\nthose agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a\nnew market mechanism that would set prices separately\nfor various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,\n103 FERC \u00b661,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).\n  In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure\nresponsive to FERC\u2019s directions. See Devon Power LLC,\n107 FERC \u00b661,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter\nfor hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),\nwho issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO\u2019s\nproposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC \u00b663,063, p. 65,205\n(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s order;\non September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu\u00ad\nments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter\nestablished settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113\nFERC \u00b661,075, p. 61,271 (2005).\n  After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a\nsettlement was reached.

Circuit\u2019s judgment insofar as it rejected application\nof Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.\n                               II\n  The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the \u201csale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\u201d See\n16 U. S. C. \u00a7824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities\nto set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and\nbuyers may agree on rates by contract. See \u00a7824d(c), (d).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must\nbe \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d \u00a7824d(a). Rates may be exam\u00ad\nined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own\ninitiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed\nor after a rate goes into effect. \u00a7\u00a7824d(e), 824e(a). Follow\u00ad\ning a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate\nfound \u201cunjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or\npreferential,\u201d and replace it with a just and reasonable\nrate. \u00a7824e(a).\n  The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions\nannounced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line\n\f6       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL. COMM\u2019N                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCo. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.\nSierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned\nrates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved\nthe Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili\u00ad\nties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.\n15 U. S. C. \u00a7717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility\u2019s\nargument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author\u00ad\nized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur\u00ad\nchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336\u2013337.\nFiling, we explained, was a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful\ncontract. Id., at 339\u2013344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had\nthe Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed\ntariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com\u00ad\nmission had suggested that, in any event, the contract\nrate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust\nand unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so\n\u201csolely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair\nreturn on the [utility\u2019s] net invested capital.\u201d 350 U. S., at\n355.\n   The Commission\u2019s suggestion prompted this Court to\nhome in on \u201cthe question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The\nSierra Court answered the question this way:\n    \u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af\u00ad\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar\u00ad\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n     Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n     low as to adversely affect the public interest\u2014as where\n     it might impair the financial ability of the public util\u00ad\n     ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers\n     an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.\u201d\n     350 U. S., at 354\u2013355 (some emphasis added).\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: \u201cThe regulatory\nsystem created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual\nagreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa\u00ad\nnies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.\u201d Per\nmian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3\n   Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the\nCourt reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\nThat case presented two questions: First, does the Mobile-\nSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated\nbetween sophisticated parties meet the just and reason\u00ad\nable standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. \u00a7824d(a)) \u201capply only\nwhen FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a\ncontract rate without the presumption?\u201d 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 1). \u201cSecond, does the presumption [generally]\nimpose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of whole\u00ad\nsale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?\u201d Id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in Mobile-\n\nSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and\nWater Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110\u2013113 (1958), that parties may contract\nout of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by\nspecifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission\nwould supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an\noption midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract\nthat does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a\nnew rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the\ncontract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further\nshowing that it adversely affects the public interest. See, e.g., Papago\nTribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisiana\nPower & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675\u2013676 (CA5 1979).\n\f8       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Answering no to\nthe first question and yes to the second, the Court empha\u00ad\nsized the essential role of contracts as a key factor foster\u00ad\ning stability in the electricity market, to the longrun bene\u00ad\nfit of consumers.

But Morgan Stanley\u2019s reasoning strongly sug\u00ad\ngests that the D. C. Circuit\u2019s negative answer misperceives\nthe aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine.\n   In unmistakably plain language, Morgan Stanley re\u00ad\nstated Mobile-Sierra\u2019s instruction to the Commission:\nFERC \u201cmust presume that the rate set out in a freely\nnegotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the \u2018just and\nreasonable\u2019 requirement imposed by law. The presump\u00ad\ntion may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the\ncontract seriously harms the public interest.\u201d 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). As our instruction to FERC in Morgan\nStanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the\nD. C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and\nsometimes at odds with, the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d stan\u00ad\ndard, see 520 F. 3d, at 478; rather, the public interest\nstandard defines \u201cwhat it means for a rate to satisfy the\njust-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.\u201d\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

And if\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption? 4\n   Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook\nthird-party interests; it is framed with a view to their\nprotection. The doctrine directs the Commission to reject\na contract rate that \u201cseriously harms the consuming pub\u00ad\nlic.\u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); see\nVerizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479\n(2002) (When a buyer and a seller agree upon a rate, \u201cthe\nprincipal regulatory responsibility [i]s not to relieve a\ncontracting party of an unreasonable rate, . . . but to pro\u00ad\ntect against potential discrimination by favorable contract\nrates between allied businesses to the detriment of other\nwholesale customers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).\n   Finally, as earlier indicated, see supra, at 7\u20138, the D. C.\nCircuit\u2019s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges\nby contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose\nof the doctrine: promotion of \u201cthe stability of supply ar\u00ad\nrangements which all agree is essential to the health of\nthe [energy] industry.\u201d Mobile, 350 U.

Mobile-\nSierra holds sway, however, because well-informed wholesale-market\nparticipants of approximately equal bargaining power generally can be\nexpected to negotiate just-and-reasonable rates, see Morgan Stanley\nCapital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 17), and because \u201ccontract stability\nultimately benefits consumers,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 22). These\nreasons for the presumption explain why FERC, surely not legally\nbound by a contract rate, must apply the presumption and, correspond\u00ad\ningly, why third parties are similarly controlled by it.\n\f10        NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

A presumption\napplicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as\nto everyone else\u2014consumers, advocacy groups, state\nutility commissions, elected officials acting parens pa\ntriae\u2014could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra\naimed to secure.5\n   We therefore hold that the Mobile-Sierra presumption\ndoes not depend on the identity of the complainant who\nseeks FERC investigation. The presumption is not limited\nto challenges to contract rates brought by contracting\nparties.

Only if the rate was so\nlow that the seller might be unable to stay in business,\nthereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be\nexcused from performing its contract. That is what the\nCourt held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas\nService Corp., 350 U. S. 332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348 (1956).\n  In the second chapter the Court unwisely and incor\nrectly held that the same rule should apply to a buyer who\nhad been forced by unprecedented market conditions to\nenter into a long-term contract to buy energy at abnor\nmally high prices. The Court held the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a\ncontract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad\ndled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be\nconsidered unjust and unreasonable under normal market\n\f2         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

But applying the\npresumption nonetheless sets a higher bar for a rate chal\nlenge.1 FERC may abrogate the rate only if the public\ninterest is seriously harmed.

Ibid.\n   But even accepting Morgan Stanley as the law, the\nCourt unwisely goes further today. In this third chapter of\nthe Mobile-Sierra story, the Court applies a rule\u2014one\ndesigned initially to protect the enforceability of freely\nnegotiated contracts against parties who seek a release\nfrom their obligations\u2014to impose a special burden on\nthird parties exercising their statutory right to object to\nunjust and unreasonable rates. This application of the\nrule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set\nforth in the first chapter of this tale. As the Court of\nAppeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court\nsets aside today: \u201cThis case is clearly outside the scope of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\u201d Maine Pub. Util.

This Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of Sierra provides an answer. \u201cSierra was\ngrounded in the commonsense notion that \u2018[i]n wholesale\nmarkets, the party charging the rate and the party\ncharged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying\npresumptively equal bargaining power, who could be\nexpected to negotiate a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate as be\ntween the two of them.\u2019 \u201d Morgan Stanley, 554 U.

This\n\u201ccommonsense notion\u201d supports the rule requiring FERC\nto apply a presumption against letting a party out of its\nown contract, as the D. C. Circuit recognized. 520 F. 3d,\nat 478 (\u201cThe Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies a more defer\nential standard of review to preserve the terms of the\nbargain as between the contracting parties\u201d). It does not,\nhowever, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a pre\nsumption against abrogating any rate set by contract,\neven when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be\nrequired in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.\n   The Court further reasons that \u201cconfinement of Mobile-\nSierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes\nthe animating purpose of the doctrine,\u201d which is ensuring\nthe stability of contract-based supply arrangements.

Furthermore, the Court\ntoday reiterates that the doctrine poses a high bar. See\nante, at 7\u20138.\n   It was sensible to require a contracting party to show\nsomething more than its own desire to get out of what\nproved to be a bad bargain before FERC could abrogate\nthe parties\u2019 bargain. It is not sensible, nor authorized by\nthe statute, for the Court to change the de facto standard\nof review whenever a rate is set by private contract, based\nsolely on the Court\u2019s view that contract stability should be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In my view, \u201cwhether a rate is \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 is measured\n\nagainst the public interest, not the private interests of regulated\n[parties].\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But I note the Court\u2019s assertion\nthat the Mobile-Sierra doctrine protects \u201cthird-party interests,\u201d ante, at\n9, is a new twist on the \u201cpublic interest standard\u201d as traditionally\nunderstood. As the Court recognized in Morgan Stanley, one conse\nquence of applying Mobile-Sierra is that \u201c \u2018the sole concern of the\nCommission\u2019 \u201d is the public interest, and FERC cannot consider, for\nexample, whether a rate guarantees a sufficient rate of return to a\nregulated entity. 554 U.

In addition to requiring that\nFERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be\nrequired under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore,\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine leaves little room for respondents\u2014at least\none of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase\nelectricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self\nsupplies its capacity\u2014to assert their private interest in making a rate\nchallenge. The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under\nthe public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates\nbetween allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale custom\ners, ante, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still\nhave to show that circumstance harmed the public interest. It remains\nunclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell\nelectricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the\n\u201cpublic interest standard\u201d because the rate is detrimental to that\nentity\u2019s private interest.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

SPISAK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013724.      Argued October 13, 2009\u2014Decided January 12, 2010\nAfter the Ohio courts sentenced respondent Spisak to death and denied\n  his claims on direct appeal and collateral review, he filed a federal\n  habeas petition claiming that, at his trial\u2019s penalty phase, (1) the in\n  structions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to\n  consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to\n  be mitigating, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and (2) his coun\n  sel\u2019s inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assis\n  tance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The\n  District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both\n  arguments and ordered relief.\nHeld:\n    1. Because the state court\u2019s upholding of the mitigation jury in\n structions and forms was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable ap\n plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]\n Court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from\n reaching a contrary decision. The Court of Appeals erred in holding\n that the instructions and forms contravened Mills, in which this\n Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue vio\n lated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that\n it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all\n 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to\n exist, 486 U. S., at 380\u2013381, 384. Even assuming that Mills sets\n forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for reviewing the\n state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here\n differ significantly from those in Mills: They made clear that, to rec\n ommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that\n each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circum\n stances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the exis\n\f2                            SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously. Nor did they\n    say anything about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make in\n    dividual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance\n    existed. They focused only on the overall question of balancing the\n    aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury\n    to consider all relevant evidence. Thus, the instructions and verdict\n    forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or\n    what they implied, the constitutional error in the Mills instructions.\n    Pp. 2\u20139.\n       2. Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\n    assistance-of-counsel claim was not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreason\n    able application\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n    \u00a72254(d)(1). To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, inter alia,\n    that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unpro\n    fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ\n    ent.\u201d Strickland, supra, at 694. Even assuming that the closing ar\n    gument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court\n    finds no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing argument\n    without these defects would have made a significant difference. Any\n    different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in\n    the following context: Spisak\u2019s defense at the trial\u2019s guilt phase con\n    sisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by\n    reason of insanity. Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate\n    Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where\n    he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shoot\n    ings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further mur\n    ders if given the opportunity. In light of this background and for the\n    following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not\n    raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for\n    the deficient closing. First, since the sentencing phase took place\n    immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds\n    the government\u2019s extensive and graphic evidence regarding the kill\n    ings, Spisak\u2019s boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats\n    to commit further violent acts. Second, although counsel did not\n    summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it,\n    and the defense experts\u2019 more detailed testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s\n    mental illness was also fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds. Third, Spisak does\n    not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have men\n    tioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the\n    \u201cmental defect\u201d factor that the defense experts described. Finally, in\n    light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the jurors\u2019 sense of humanity, it\n    is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could\n    have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing\n    circumstances. The Court need not reach Spisak\u2019s claim that\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in\nan Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted\nmurders. He was sentenced to death. He filed a habeas\ncorpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitu\ntional errors occurred at his trial. First, Spisak claimed\nthat the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitu\ntionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only\nthose factors that the jury unanimously found to be miti\ngating. See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).\nSecond, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm\nas a result of his counsel\u2019s inadequate closing argument at\nthe penalty phase of the proceeding. See Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Federal Court of\nAppeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas\nrelief. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                            I\n  In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders\nand two attempted murders at Cleveland State University\nin 1982. The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a\ndeath sentence. The Ohio courts denied Spisak\u2019s claims,\n\f2                     SMITH v.

E. 2d 719 (1995) (per\ncuriam).\n   Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.\nAmong other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase\nof his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two\nreasons we consider here. The District Court denied his\npetition. Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio,\nApr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. But the Court of\nAppeals accepted Spisak\u2019s two claims, namely, his mitiga\ntion instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of\ncounsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d 684, 703\u2013706,\n708\u2013711 (CA6 2006). The Court of Appeals consequently\nordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of\nhabeas corpus forbidding Spisak\u2019s execution. Id., at 715\u2013\n716.\n   The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.\nWe granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019\njudgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U. S. 945 (2007). We\nremanded the case for further consideration in light of two\nrecent cases in which this Court had held that lower fed\neral courts had not properly taken account of the defer\nence federal law grants state-court determinations on\nfederal habeas review.

Hudson, 512 F. 3d\n852, 853\u2013854 (2008). The State again sought certiorari.\nWe again granted the petition. And we now reverse.\n                             II\n  Spisak\u2019s first claim concerns the instructions and verdict\nforms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial. The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instruc\ntions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instruc\ntions, taken together with the forms, \u201crequire[d]\u201d juror\n\u201cunanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor\u201d\u2014\ncontrary to this Court\u2019s holding in Mills v. Maryland,\nsupra. 465 F. 3d, at 708. Since the parties do not dispute\nthat the Ohio courts \u201cadjudicated\u201d this claim, i.e., they\nconsidered and rejected it \u201con the merits,\u201d the law permits\na federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the\nstate-court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an un\nreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). Unlike the Court of\nAppeals, we conclude that Spisak\u2019s claim does not satisfy\nthis standard.\n   The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that\nMills sets forth the pertinent \u201cclearly established Federal\nlaw.\u201d While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether\nMills was \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for the purpose\nof reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we shall\nassume the same. Compare Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 390 (2000) (STEVENS, J., for the Court) (applicable\ndate for purposes of determining whether \u201cFederal law\u201d is\n\u201cestablished\u201d is when the \u201cstate-court conviction became\nfinal\u201d), with id., at 412 (O\u2019Connor, J., for the Court) (appli\ncable date is \u201cthe time of the relevant state-court deci\nsion\u201d); see State v.

Maryland, supra (decided\nJune 6, 1988).\n                             A\n  The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two\nwell-established principles. First, the Constitution forbids\nimposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or\njury is \u201c \u2018 \u201cprecluded from considering, as a mitigating\n\f4                     SMITH v.

S., at 374 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,\n110 (1982), in turn quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,\n604 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Second, the sentencing\njudge or jury \u201c \u2018 may not refuse to consider or be precluded\nfrom considering \u201cany relevant mitigating evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nMills, 486 U. S., at 374\u2013375 (quoting Skipper v. South\nCarolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings,\nsupra, at 114).\n   Applying these principles, the Court held that the jury\ninstructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated\nthe Constitution because, read naturally, they told the\njury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be\nmitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating\ncircumstance had been proved to exist. Mills, 486 U. S., at\n380\u2013381, 384. If, for example, the defense presents evi\ndence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some\njurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some\nonly the second, and some only the third. But if even one\nof the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating\nconsiderations exists, but that he is barred from consider\ning it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held,\nthe Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.\nSee id., at 380, 384; see also McKoy v. North Carolina, 494\nU. S. 433, 442\u2013443 (1990) (\u201cMills requires that each juror\nbe permitted to consider and give effect to . . . all mitigat\ning evidence in deciding . . . whether aggravating circum\nstances outweigh mitigating circumstances . . . \u201d). Because\nthe instructions in Mills would have led a reasonable juror\nto believe the contrary, the Court held that the sentencing\nproceeding violated the Constitution. 486 U.

S., at 384\u2013385 (emphasis added;\n    internal quotation marks omitted).\nSection II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating\ncircumstances (seven specific circumstances and the\neighth designated as \u201cother\u201d) next to which were spaces\nwhere the jury was to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Just above the\nlist the form said:\n       \u201cBased upon the evidence we unanimously find that\n    each of the following mitigating circumstances which\n    is marked \u2018yes\u2019 has been proven to exist . . . and each\n    mitigating circumstance marked \u2018no\u2019 has not been\n    proven . . . .\u201d Id., at 387 (emphasis added; internal\n    quotation marks omitted).\nSection III set forth the overall balancing question, along\nwith spaces for the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d It said:\n       \u201cBased on the evidence we unanimously find that it\n    has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances\n    marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section II outweigh the aggravating\n    circumstances marked \u2018yes\u2019 in Section I.\u201d Id., at 388\u2013\n    389 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit\n\f6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    ted).\n   Explaining the forms, the judge instructed the jury with\nan example. He told the jury that it should mark \u201c \u2018yes\u2019 \u201d\non the jury form if it \u201c \u2018unanimously\u2019 \u201d concluded that an\naggravating circumstance had been proved. Id., at 378.\nOtherwise, he said, \u201c \u2018of course you must answer no.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (emphasis deleted). These instructions, together\nwith the forms, told the jury to mark \u201cyes\u201d on Section II\u2019s\nlist of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously\nconcluded that the particular mitigating factor had been\nproved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section\nIII only those mitigating factors marked \u201cyes\u201d in Section\nII. Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that\nit could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravat\ning and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors\nthat the jury had unanimously found to exist. See id., at\n380\u2013381.\n   The instructions and jury forms in this case differ sig\nnificantly from those in Mills. The trial judge instructed\nthe jury that the aggravating factors they would consider\nwere the specifications that the jury had found proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial\u2014\nessentially, that each murder was committed in a course of\nconduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the\nmurders, that the murder was committed with the intent\nto evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.\n8 Tr. 2967\u20132972 (July 19, 1983).\n   He then explained the concept of a \u201cmitigating factor.\u201d\nAfter doing so, he listed examples, including that \u201cthe\ndefendant because of a mental disease or defect . . . lacked\nsubstantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of\nthe law.\u201d Id., at 2972\u20132973. The court also told the jury\nthat it could take account of \u201cany other\u201d mitigating consid\neration it found \u201crelevant to the issue of whether the\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d Id., at 2973.\nAnd he instructed the jury that the State bore the burden\nof proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating\ncircumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Id., at\n2965.\n   With respect to \u201cthe procedure\u201d by which the jury should\nreach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following:\n    \u201c[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant\n    evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony\n    received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.\n    From this you must determine whether, beyond a rea\n    sonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which\n    [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the\n    separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors present in this case.\n      \u201cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stance in each separate count outweighs the mitigat\n    ing factors, then you must return that finding to the\n    Court.\n         .           .           .          .            .\n      \u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the\n    testimony received at this hearing and the arguments\n    of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of com\n    mitting in the separate counts outweigh the\n    mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine\n    which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to\n    recommend to the Court.\u201d Id., at 2973\u20132975.\n  The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each ag\ngravating factor. The first of the two forms said:\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury in this case . . . do find beyond a reason\n    able doubt that the aggravating circumstance . . . was\n\f8                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present\n\n    in this case.\n\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury recommend that the sentence of death \n\n    be imposed . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 2975\u20132976. \n\nThe other verdict form read:\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury . . . do find that the aggravating circum\n    stances . . . are not sufficient to outweigh the mitiga\n    tion factors present in this case.\n    \u201c \u2018We the jury recommend that the defendant . . . be\n    sentenced to life imprisonment . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 2976.\n   The instructions and forms made clear that, to recom\nmend a death sentence, the jury had to find, unanimously\nand beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the aggravat\ning factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances. But\nthe instructions did not say that the jury must determine\nthe existence of each individual mitigating factor unani\nmously. Neither the instructions nor the forms said any\nthing about how\u2014or even whether\u2014the jury should make\nindividual determinations that each particular mitigating\ncircumstance existed. They focused only on the overall\nbalancing question. And the instructions repeatedly told\nthe jury to \u201cconside[r] all of the relevant evidence.\u201d Id., at\n2974. In our view the instructions and verdict forms did\nnot clearly bring about, either through what they said or\nwhat they implied, the circumstance that Mills found\ncritical, namely,\n    \u201ca substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon\n    receiving the judge\u2019s instructions in this case, and in\n    attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,\n    well may have thought they were precluded from con\n    sidering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors\n    agreed on the existence of a particular such circum\n    stance.\u201d 486 U. S., at 384.\nWe consequently conclude that that the state court\u2019s deci\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsion upholding these forms and instructions was not \u201ccon\ntrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States\u201d in Mills.          28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury in\nstructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that\nthe instructions \u201crequire[d] the jury to unanimously reject\na death sentence before considering other sentencing\nalternatives.\u201d 465 F. 3d, at 709 (citing Maples v. Coyle,\n171 F. 3d 408, 416\u2013417 (CA6 1999)). We have not, how\never, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for\nthis reason. Mills says nothing about the matter. Neither\nthe parties nor the courts below referred to Beck v. Ala\nbama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), or identified any other prece\ndent from this Court setting forth this rule. Cf. Jones v.\nUnited States, 527 U. S. 373, 379\u2013384 (1999) (rejecting an\narguably analogous claim). But see post, at 3\u20135 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). What\never the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict\nforms in this case were we to consider them on direct\nappeal, the jury instructions at Spisak\u2019s trial were not\ncontrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n                            III\n  Spisak\u2019s second claim is that his counsel\u2019s closing argu\nment at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inade\nquate as to violate the Sixth Amendment. To prevail,\nSpisak must show both that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a \u201creasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d\nid., at 694.\n  The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak\u2019s claim was\n\f10                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnot well-taken on the basis of our review of the record.\u201d\nState v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802\n(citing, inter alia, Strickland, supra). The District Court\nconcluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job\nand that \u201c[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability\nthat, absent counsel\u2019s alleged errors, the jury would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\u201d Spisak v. Coyle,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 204a. The Court of Appeals, how\never, reached a contrary conclusion. It held that counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument, measured by \u201c \u2018an objective standard of\nreasonableness,\u2019 \u201d was inadequate, and it asserted that \u201ca\nreasonable probability exists \u201d that adequate representa\ntion would have led to a different result. 465 F. 3d, at 703,\n706 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688). Responding to the\nState\u2019s petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 terse finding of a \u201creasonable probabil\nity\u201d that a more adequate argument would have changed a\njuror\u2019s vote.\n   In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak\u2019s\ncounsel described Spisak\u2019s killings in some detail. He\nacknowledged that Spisak\u2019s admiration for Hitler inspired\nhis crimes. He portrayed Spisak as \u201csick,\u201d \u201ctwisted,\u201d and\n\u201cdemented.\u201d 8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983). And he said that\nSpisak was \u201cnever going to be any different.\u201d Ibid. He\nthen pointed out that all the experts had testified that\nSpisak suffered from some degree of mental illness. And,\nafter a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his\nown decisions about calling expert witnesses and prepar\ning them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not\nlegally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by\nreason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently men\ntally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he\nshould not be executed. Counsel also told the jury that,\nwhen weighing Spisak\u2019s mental illness against the \u201csub\nstantial\u201d aggravating factors present in the case, id., at\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of \u201cpride\u201d\nfor living in \u201ca humane society\u201d made up of \u201ca humane\npeople,\u201d id., at 2897\u20132900, 2926\u20132928. That humanity,\nhe said, required the jury to weigh the evidence \u201cfairly\u201d\nand to be \u201cloyal to that oath\u201d the jurors had taken to up\nhold the law. Id., at 2926.\n   Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument\nwas constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly\nemphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it\noverly emphasized Spisak\u2019s threats to continue his crimes;\n(3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based\ntheir mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing\nabout any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5)\nit made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict\nagainst death.\n   We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct\nthat the closing argument was inadequate. We neverthe\nless find no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a better closing\nargument without these defects would have made a sig\nnificant difference.\n   Any different, more adequate closing argument would\nhave taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted\nthat he had committed three murders and two other shoot\nings. Spisak\u2019s defense at the guilt phase of the trial con\nsisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not\nguilty by reason of insanity. And counsel, apparently\nhoping to demonstrate Spisak\u2019s mentally defective condi\ntion, called him to the stand.\n   Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace\nRickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford. He also\nadmitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Har\ndaway, and shot at Coletta Dartt. He committed these\ncrimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler,\nwho was Spisak\u2019s \u201cspiritual leader\u201d in a \u201cwar\u201d for \u201csur\nvival\u201d of \u201cthe Aryan people.\u201d 4 id., at 1343\u20131344, 1396\n(July 5, 1983). He said that he had purchased guns and\n\f12                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstockpiled ammunition to further this war. Id., at 1406\u2013\n1408. And he had hoped to \u201ccreate terror\u201d at Cleveland\nState University, because it was \u201cone of the prime targets\u201d\nwhere the \u201cJews and the system . . . are brainwashing the\nyouth.\u201d Id., at 1426\u20131428.\n   Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot\nRickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a\nsexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom. He\nexpressed satisfaction at having \u201celiminated that particu\nlar threat . . . to me and to the white race.\u201d 5 id., at 1511\n(July 7, 1983). In June he saw a stranger, John Har\ndaway, on a train platform and shot him seven times\nbecause he had been looking for a black person to kill as\n\u201cblood atonement\u201d for a recent crime against two white\nwomen. 4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983). He added that he\nfelt \u201cgood\u201d after shooting Hardaway because he had \u201cac\ncomplished something,\u201d but later felt \u201c[k]ind of bad\u201d when\nhe learned that Hardaway had survived. Id., at 1424\u2013\n1425. In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt be\ncause, he said, he heard her \u201cmaking some derisive re\nmarks about us,\u201d meaning the Nazi Party. Id., at 1432\u2013\n1435. Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy\nSheehan because he \u201cthought he was one of those Jewish\nprofessors . . . that liked to hang around in the men\u2019s room\nand seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that\ngo there.\u201d 5 id., at 1465\u20131466 (July 7, 1983). Spisak\nadded that he was \u201csorry about that\u201d murder because he\nlater learned Sheehan \u201cwasn\u2019t Jewish like I thought he\nwas.\u201d Ibid. And three days later, while on a \u201csearch and\ndestroy mission,\u201d he shot and killed Brian Warford, a\nyoung black man who \u201clooked like he was almost asleep\u201d\nin a bus shelter, to fulfill his \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cinflict the maxi\nmum amount of casualties on the enemies.\u201d Id., at 1454\u2013\n1455, 1478.\n   Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit\nsimilar crimes if he had the chance. He said about War\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nford\u2019s murder that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get caught that time\nbecause I wanted to be able to do it again and again and\nagain and again.\u201d Id., at 1699 (July 8, 1983). In a letter\nwritten to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and\nWarford \u201cthe finest thing I ever did in my whole life\u201d and\nexpressed a wish that he \u201chad a human submachine gun\nright now so I could exterminate\u201d black men \u201cand watch\nthem scream and twitch in agony.\u201d Id., at 1724\u20131725.\nAnd he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would\nescape from jail, \u201cgo out and continue the war I started,\u201d\nand \u201ccontinue to inflict the maximum amount of damage\non the enemies as I am able to do.\u201d Id., at 1780\u20131781.\n  The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak\nwas lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives\nfor these crimes. The State contended instead that the\nshootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such\nas robbery. See id., at 1680, 1816\u20131818.\n  The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by\nreason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused\nto instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded\nexpert testimony regarding Spisak\u2019s mental state. The\ndefense\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a\nreport diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a \u201cschizotypal\npersonality disorder\u201d and an \u201catypical psychotic disorder,\u201d\nand as, at times, \u201cunable to control his impulses to as\nsault.\u201d 6 id., at 1882\u20131883, 1992 (July 11, 1983). His\ntestimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir\ndire, however. On cross-examination, he conceded that he\ncould not say Spisak failed Ohio\u2019s sanity standard at the\ntime of the murders. After Markey made the same conces\nsion before the jury, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s\nrenewed motion to exclude Markey\u2019s testimony and in\nstructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.\nAnd the court excluded the defense\u2019s proffered reports\nfrom other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined\nSpisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met\n\f14                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes. Id.,\nat 1898\u20131899, 1911\u20131912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July\n12, 1983).\n   During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense\ncounsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified\nthat Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.\nDr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that\nSpisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personal\nity disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid think\ning, gender identification conflict, and emotional instabil\nity. She added that these defects \u201csubstantially impair his\nability to conform himself\u201d to the law\u2019s requirements. 8\nid., at 2428\u20132429, 2430\u20132441 (July 16, 1983). Dr. Kurt\nBertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered\nfrom a schizotypal personality disorder and that \u201cmental\nillness does impair his reason to the extent that he has\nsubstantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial\ninability to refrain.\u201d Id., at 2552\u20132556. Dr. Markey,\nwhose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase,\nagain testified and agreed with the other experts\u2019 diagno\nses. Id., at 2692\u20132693, 2712\u20132713 (July 18, 1983).\n   In light of this background and for the following rea\nsons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in\ndefense counsel\u2019s closing argument raise \u201ca reasonable\nprobability that,\u201d but for the deficient closing, \u201cthe result\nof the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 694. We therefore cannot find the Ohio\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Spisak\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim to be an \u201cunreasonable appli\ncation\u201d of the law \u201cclearly established\u201d in Strickland.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately\nfollowing the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had\nfresh in their minds the government\u2019s evidence regarding\nthe killings\u2014which included photographs of the dead\nbodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel\u2019s\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvivid descriptions of the crimes\u2014as well as Spisak\u2019s boast\nful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit\nfurther acts of violence. We therefore do not see how a\nless descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging\ncomments about Spisak could have made a significant\ndifference.\n   Similarly fresh in the jurors\u2019 minds was the three de\nfense experts\u2019 testimony that Spisak suffered from mental\nillness. The jury had heard the experts explain the spe\ncific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as\nwell as what they had learned of his family background\nand his struggles with gender identity. And the jury had\nheard the experts draw connections between his mental\nillness and the crimes. We do not see how it could have\nmade a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his\nactual argument\u2014which emphasized mental illness as a\nmitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\u2019\ntestimony\u2014by repeating the facts or connections that the\nexperts had just described.\n   Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors\ncounsel might have mentioned. All those he proposes\nessentially consist of aspects of the \u201cmental defect\u201d factor\nthat the defense experts described.\n   Finally, in light of counsel\u2019s several appeals to the ju\nrors\u2019 sense of humanity\u2014he used the words \u201chumane\npeople\u201d and \u201chumane society\u201d 10 times at various points in\nthe argument\u2014we cannot find that a more explicit or\nmore elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the\nresult, either alone or together with the other circum\nstances just discussed. Thus, we conclude that there is not\na reasonable probability that a more adequate closing\nargument would have changed the result, and that the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Spisak\u2019s claim was not\n\u201ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of\u201d Strick\nland. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review\n\f16                    SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder \u00a72254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because\nthe Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the ques\ntion whether counsel\u2019s closing argument caused Spisak\nprejudice. That is, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s summary\nrejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court\nrested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was\nnot ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not\nhave made a difference, or (3) both. See State v. Spisak,\n36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802. Spisak argues\nthat, under these circumstances, a federal court should\nnot defer to a state court that may not have decided a\nquestion, but instead should decide the matter afresh.\nLower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to\nSpisak\u2019s. See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F. 3d 330, 334\u2013\n335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225,\n231, 237 (2000) (applying the \u00a72254(d) standard in case\ninvolving a state court\u2019s summary denial of a claim,\nthough not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing\nregarding whether or how \u00a72254(d) applied to a summary\ndecision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606\n(CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) (relying on Weeks in holding that\n\u00a72254(d) applies where a state court denies a claim on the\nmerits without giving any indication how it reached its\ndecision); see generally 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal\nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a732.2, pp. 1574\u2013\n1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.). However, we need\nnot decide whether deference under \u00a72254(d)(1) is re\nquired here. With or without such deference, our conclu\nsion is the same.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

FRANK G.\n\n                 SPISAK, JR. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [January 12, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment.\n  In my judgment the Court of Appeals correctly con\ncluded that two errors that occurred during Spisak\u2019s trial\nviolated clearly established federal law. First, the jury\ninstructions impermissibly required that the jury unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing options. Second, the closing argument of\nSpisak\u2019s counsel was so egregious that it was constitution\nally deficient under any standard. Nevertheless, for the\nreasons set forth in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at\n11\u201315, I agree that these errors did not prejudice Spisak\nand thus he is not entitled to relief.\n                              I\n  The jury instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty\nphase, described in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 6\u20138, are\nfairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the\ndeath penalty is warranted\u2014i.e., whether the aggravating\nfactors outweigh the mitigating factors\u2014before moving on\nto consider whether instead a lesser penalty\u2014i.e., one of\ntwo available life sentences\u2014is appropriate. Consistent\nwith Ohio law at the time of Spisak\u2019s trial,1 the jury was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Ohio no longer uses the type of jury instructions at issue in this\n\ncase. In 1996 the Ohio Supreme Court instructed that \u201c[i]n Ohio, a\n\f2                         SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ntold that it must reach its decision unanimously. The jury\nwas not instructed on the consequence of their failure to\nagree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to\ndeath. Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described\nthese instructions as \u201cacquittal first\u201d because they would\nhave led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to\n\u201cacquit\u201d the defendant of death\u2014unanimously\u2014before it\ncould give effect to a lesser penalty.\n   Following its prior decision in Davis v. Mitchell, 318\nF. 3d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down \u201cvirtually\nidentical\u201d jury instructions, Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d\n684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe instructions given during Spisak\u2019s penalty phase were\nimpermissible because they \u201crequire[d] the jury to unani\nmously reject a death sentence before considering other\nsentencing alternatives,\u201d id., at 709. In Davis, the court\nhad explained that an instruction that requires a capital\njury to \u201cfirst unanimously reject the death penalty before\nit can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual\njury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .\u201d 318\nF. 3d, at 689. The source of this constitutional infirmity,\nthe court decided, was our decision in Mills v. Maryland,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsolitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding\nthat the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the\nmitigating factors. Jurors from this point forward should be so in\nstructed.\u201d State v. Brooks, 75 Ohio St. 3d 148, 162, 661 N. E. 2d 1030,\n1042. Although the Brooks decision signaled a change in Ohio\u2019s capital\njury instructions, it was not a change in state law: One juror had the\npower to prevent a death penalty recommendation before Brooks. See\nState v. Springer, 63 Ohio St. 3d 167, 172, 586 N. E. 2d 96, 100 (1992)\n(holding that an offender must be sentenced to life if the penalty-phase\njury deadlocks). Thus, consistent with our view that \u201caccurate sentenc\ning information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury\u2019s] determina\ntion of whether a defendant shall live or die,\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153, 190 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS,\nJJ.), the Ohio high court laudably improved upon the accuracy of Ohio\ncapital jury instructions in Brooks.\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n486 U. S. 367 (1988). For the reasons cogently examined\nin JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion, ante, at 5\u20139, I agree that\nMills does not clearly establish that the instructions at\nissue were unconstitutional. But, in my view, our decision\nin Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), does.2\n  In Beck we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed \u201cwhen the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d\nId., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that\ntime, the Alabama death penalty statute had been \u201cconsis\ntently construed to preclude any lesser included offense\ninstructions in capital cases.\u201d Id., at 629, n. 3. Thus, the\nAlabama jury was \u201cgiven the choice of either convicting\nthe defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was]\nrequired to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him,\nthus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged\nparticipation in the crime.\u201d Id., at 628\u2013629. Because of\nthe unique features of Alabama\u2019s capital punishment\nsystem,3 Beck\u2019s jury believed that either it had to convict\nBeck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus\nsetting him free. The jury was not presented with the\n\u201cthird option\u201d of convicting him of a noncapital offense,\nthus ensuring that he would receive a substantial pun\nishment but not receive the death penalty. Id., at 642.\nWe concluded that the false choice before the jury\u2014death\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Notably, Beck substantially predates Spisak\u2019s trial and thus my\napplication of Beck obviates any discussion on when federal law is\nestablished for Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\npurposes, see ante, at 3. Regardless, in accordance with the view I\nexpressed in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 379\u2013380 (2000) (opinion\nof STEVENS, J.), I would conclude that our decision in Mills, decided\nbefore Spisak\u2019s conviction became final, is also available to him.\n  3 Under Alabama law, the judge conducts a separate penalty-phase\n\nproceeding after the jury has returned a conviction on a capital offense.\nBeck, 447 U. S., at 629. Thus, the jury reasonably believed that its\nverdict would set the defendant\u2019s punishment at death.\n\f4                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nor acquit\u2014\u201cintroduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreli\nability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated\nin a capital case.\u201d Id., at 643. In other words,\n    \u201cthe difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it in\n    terjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding\n    process, diverting the jury\u2019s attention from the central\n    issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of\n    proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n    is guilty of a capital crime. Thus, on the one hand, the\n    unavailability of the third option of convicting on a\n    lesser included offense may encourage the jury to con\n    vict for an impermissible reason\u2014its belief that the\n    defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should\n    be punished. On the other hand, the apparently\n    mandatory nature of the death penalty may encour\n    age it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason\u2014\n    that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not de\n    serve death.\u201d Id., at 642\u2013643.\n  Although Beck dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the\nreach of its holding is not so limited. The \u201cthird option\u201d we\ndiscussed in Beck was, plainly, a life sentence. Moreover,\nthe unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing\nscheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the\njury (but not before the judge). Our concern in Beck was\nthat presenting the jury with only two options\u2014death or\nno punishment\u2014introduced a risk of arbitrariness and\nerror into the deliberative process that the Constitution\ncould not abide in the capital context. See Spaziano v.\nFlorida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984) (\u201cThe goal of the Beck\nrule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the\nfactfinding process that is created when the jury is forced\ninto an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and\ninnocence\u201d). We held, therefore, that the jury must be\ngiven a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace\nthe equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence sup\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nports such an option.\n   The acquittal-first jury instructions used during\nSpisak\u2019s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same\nfalse choice that our holding in Beck prohibits. By requir\ning Spisak\u2019s jury to decide first whether the State had met\nits burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach\nthat decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the\njury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third\noption that was before it, namely, a life sentence. Indeed,\nthese instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at\nissue in Beck because they would have led individual\njurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might\nhave resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they\ncould not give effect to their determination that a life\nsentence was appropriate unless and until they had first\nconvinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the\ndeath sentence.\n   Admittedly, Spisak has never identified Beck as the\nsource of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case,\nnor did the courts below cite or rely upon it. But Spisak\nhas consistently pressed his argument in terms that are\nwholly consistent with Beck. On direct appeal he con\ntended, for example, that he:\n    \u201cwas severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms\n    because the jurors were never informed of what would\n    happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous de\n    cision. That may have led to irreparable speculation\n    that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be\n    freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing. Such\n    improper speculation may have led those not in\n    agreement with death to go along with a majority.\n    The jury should have been instructed that if they were\n    unable to unanimously agree to death they must re\n    turn a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the al\n    ternative, the court would impose a life sentence.\u201d\n\f6                     SMITH v. SPISAK\n\n                    Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n    Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of\n    Ohio).\nThe untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analo\ngous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described\nin Beck. See also 447 U. S., at 644 (\u201cIt is extremely doubt\nful that juries will understand the full implications of a\nmistrial or will have any confidence that their choice of the\nmistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.\nThus, they could have no assurance that a second trial\nwould end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser\nincluded offense\u201d (footnote omitted)). Spisak and the\nCourt of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instruc\ntions at issue in this case, but in my view Beck provides\nthe proper basis in clearly established federal law to con\nclude the instructions were unconstitutional.\n                               II\n   Petitioner defends Spisak\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing argument\nas a reasonable strategic decision \u201cto draw the sting out of\nthe prosecution\u2019s argument and gain credibility with the\njury by conceding the weaknesses of his own case.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 37. I agree that such a strategy is generally\na reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy\nunder the difficult circumstances of this case. Even\nSpisak concedes that his counsel \u201cfaced an admittedly\ndifficult case in closing argument in the penalty phase.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 43. But, surely, a strategy can be\nexecuted so poorly as to render even the most reasonable\nof trial tactics constitutionally deficient under Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). And this is such a\ncase.\n   It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious coun\nsel\u2019s closing argument was without reproducing it in its\nentirety.      The Court\u2019s assessment of the closing as\n\u201clengthy and rambling\u201d and its brief description of its\ncontent, see ante, at 10, does not accurately capture the\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

Suffice it to say\nthat the argument shares far more in common with a\nprosecutor\u2019s closing than with a criminal defense attor\nney\u2019s. Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it\nwould have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of\nmisconduct. See Brief for Steven Lubet et al. as Amici\nCuriae 15\u201316 (observing that counsel\u2019s closing argument\n\u201cwould have been improper even coming from the prosecu\ntor\u201d). A few examples are in order.\n  Presumably to take the \u201csting\u201d out of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase, Brief for Petitioner 37, counsel described his client\u2019s\nacts in vivid detail to the jury:\n     \u201c[Y]ou can smell almost the blood.

In my judgment even the most skillful of\nclosing arguments\u2014even one befitting Clarence Darrow\u2014\nwould not have created a reasonable probability of a dif\nferent outcome in this case. Similarly, in light of Spisak\u2019s\nconduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating\ncircumstances of the offense, the instructional error was\nalso harmless because it did not have a substantial and\ninjurious effect on this record, Brecht v.

In granting Carpenter\u2019s motion to compel\n Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with re\n tained counsel and the company\u2019s termination decision, the District\n Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was pro\n tected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk\n had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the Wil\n liams case. The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\n appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawk\u2019s appeal for lack\n of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\n not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under\n Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, because a\n discovery order implicating the attorney-client privilege can be ade\n quately reviewed on appeal from final judgment.\nHeld: Disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not\n qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.\n Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) Courts of Appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of appeals from all final de\n cisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.

Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514\n    U. S. 35, 42. The decisive consideration in determining whether a\n    right is effectively unreviewable is whether delaying review until the\n    entry of final judgment \u201cwould imperil a substantial public interest\u201d\n    or \u201csome particular value of a high order.\u201d Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n    345, 352\u2013353. In making this determination, the Court does not en\n    gage in an \u201cindividualized jurisdictional inquiry,\u201d Coopers & Lybrand\n    v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473, but focuses on \u201cthe entire category to\n    which a claim belongs,\u201d Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\n    Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868. If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can\n    be adequately vindicated by other means, \u201cthe chance that the litiga\n    tion at hand might be speeded, or a \u2018particular injustic[e]\u2019 averted,\u201d\n    does not provide a basis for \u00a71291 jurisdiction. Ibid. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the at\n    torney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral or\n    der appeal, including postjudgment review. Appellate courts can\n    remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same\n    way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by va\n    cating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which\n    the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.\n    Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel\n    privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review\n    apart from collateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\n    court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory\n    appeal involving \u201ca controlling question of law\u201d the prompt resolution\n    of which \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n    litigation.\u201d \u00a71292(b). Second, in extraordinary circumstances where\n    a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition\n    the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. Cheney v. United States\n    Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380. Another option is for a party\n    to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that,\n    e.g., \u201cdirec[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other desig\n    nated facts be taken as established,\u201d \u201cprohibi[t] the disobedient party\n    from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,\u201d or\n    \u201cstrik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2).\n    Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may\n    issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then\n    appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation\n    can be characterized as a criminal punishment. See, e.g., Church of\n    Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11. These es\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. \u00a71985(2) and various Geor\ngia laws. According to Carpenter\u2019s complaint, his termi\nnation came after he informed a member of Mohawk\u2019s\nhuman resources department in an e-mail that the com\npany was employing undocumented immigrants. At the\ntime, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Mohawk stood accused\nin a pending class-action lawsuit of conspiring to drive\ndown the wages of its legal employees by knowingly hiring\nundocumented workers in violation of federal and state\nracketeering laws. See Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,\nNo. 4:04\u2013cv\u201300003\u2013HLM (ND Ga., Jan. 6, 2004). Com\npany officials directed Carpenter to meet with the com\npany\u2019s retained counsel in the Williams case, and counsel\nallegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.\nWhen he refused, Carpenter alleges, Mohawk fired him\nunder false pretenses. App. 57a\u201364a.\n   After learning of Carpenter\u2019s complaint, the plaintiffs in\nthe Williams case sought an evidentiary hearing to ex\nplore Carpenter\u2019s allegations. In its response to their\nmotion, Mohawk described Carpenter\u2019s accusations as\n\u201cpure fantasy\u201d and recounted the \u201ctrue facts\u201d of Carpen\nter\u2019s dismissal. Id., at 208a.

Ibid.\n   As these events were unfolding in the Williams case,\ndiscovery was underway in Carpenter\u2019s case. Carpenter\nfiled a motion to compel Mohawk to produce information\nconcerning his meeting with retained counsel and the\ncompany\u2019s termination decision. Mohawk maintained that\nthe requested information was protected by the attorney\nclient privilege.\n   The District Court agreed that the privilege applied to\nthe requested information, but it granted Carpenter\u2019s\nmotion to compel disclosure after concluding that Mohawk\nhad implicitly waived the privilege through its representa\ntions in the Williams case. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.\nThe court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\nappeal under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). But, recognizing \u201cthe\nseriousness of its [waiver] finding,\u201d it stayed its ruling to\nallow Mohawk to explore other potential \u201cavenues to\nappeal . . . , such as a petition for mandamus or appealing\nthis Order under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a.\n   Mohawk filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ\nof mandamus to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Ap\npeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71291, holding that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\nnot qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order\nwithin the meaning of Cohen, 337 U. S. 541. \u201cUnder\nCohen,\u201d the Court of Appeals explained, \u201can order is ap\npealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed\nquestion; (2) resolves an important issue completely sepa\nrate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d 541 F. 3d\n1048, 1052 (2008) (per curiam). According to the court,\nthe District Court\u2019s waiver ruling satisfied the first two of\nthese requirements but not the third, because \u201ca discovery\norder that implicates the attorney-client privilege\u201d can be\nadequately reviewed \u201con appeal from a final judgment.\u201d\n\f4          MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

As we held in\nCohen, the statute encompasses not only judgments that\n\u201cterminate an action,\u201d but also a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral\nrulings that, although they do not end the litigation, are\nappropriately deemed \u201cfinal.\u201d Id., at 545\u2013546. \u201cThat\nsmall category includes only decisions that are conclusive,\nthat resolve important questions separate from the merits,\nand that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Three Circuits have permitted collateral order appeals of attorney\n\nclient privilege rulings.

Our admonition reflects a healthy respect for\nthe virtues of the final-judgment rule. Permitting piece\nmeal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, under\nmines \u201cefficient judicial administration\u201d and encroaches\nupon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a\n\u201cspecial role\u201d in managing ongoing litigation. Firestone\nTire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981);\nsee also Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.

This requirement\nfinds expression in two of the three traditional Cohen\nconditions. The second condition insists upon \u201cimportant\nquestions separate from the merits.\u201d Swint, 514 U.

More significantly, \u201cthe third Cohen\nquestion, whether a right is \u2018adequately vindicable\u2019 or\n\u2018effectively reviewable,\u2019 simply cannot be answered with\nout a judgment about the value of the interests that would\nbe lost through rigorous application of a final judgment\nrequirement.\u201d Digital Equipment, 511 U.

Because we agree with the\nCourt of Appeals that collateral order appeals are not\nnecessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege, we do not decide whether the\nother Cohen requirements are met.\n   Mohawk does not dispute that \u201cwe have generally de\nnied review of pretrial discovery orders.\u201d Firestone, 449\nU.

Brief for Petitioner 23.\n   We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney\nclient privilege, which \u201cis one of the oldest recognized\nprivileges for confidential communications.\u201d Swidler &\nBerlin v. United States, 524 U. S. 399, 403 (1998). By\nassuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients\nto make \u201cfull and frank\u201d disclosures to their attorneys,\nwho are then better able to provide candid advice and\neffective representation. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 389 (1981). This, in turn, serves \u201cbroader public\ninterests in the observance of law and administration of\njustice.\u201d Ibid.\n   The crucial question, however, is not whether an inter\nest is important in the abstract; it is whether deferring\nreview until final judgment so imperils the interest as to\njustify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of the entire\nclass of relevant orders. We routinely require litigants to\nwait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable\nrights, including rights central to our adversarial system.\nSee, e.g., Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 426 (holding an\norder disqualifying counsel in a civil case did not qualify\nfor immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine);\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984)\n(reaching the same result in a criminal case, notwith\nstanding the Sixth Amendment rights at stake). In Digi\ntal Equipment, we rejected an assertion that collateral\norder review was necessary to promote \u201cthe public policy\nfavoring voluntary resolution of disputes.\u201d 511 U. S., at\n881. \u201cIt defies common sense,\u201d we explained, \u201cto maintain\nthat parties\u2019 readiness to settle will be significantly damp\nened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a\nrule that a district court\u2019s decision to let allegedly barred\nlitigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of\n\f8        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nright only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff\u2019s\nfavor.\u201d Ibid.\n   We reach a similar conclusion here. In our estimation,\npostjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the\nrights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney\nclient privilege. Appellate courts can remedy the improper\ndisclosure of privileged material in the same way they\nremedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by\nvacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new\ntrial in which the protected material and its fruits are\nexcluded from evidence.\n   Dismissing such relief as inadequate, Mohawk empha\nsizes that the attorney-client privilege does not merely\n\u201cprohibi[t] use of protected information at trial\u201d; it pro\nvides a \u201cright not to disclose the privileged information in\nthe first place.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 25. Mohawk is un\ndoubtedly correct that an order to disclose privileged\ninformation intrudes on the confidentiality of attorney\nclient communications. But deferring review until final\njudgment does not meaningfully reduce the ex ante incen\ntives for full and frank consultations between clients and\ncounsel.\n   One reason for the lack of a discernible chill is that, in\ndeciding how freely to speak, clients and counsel are\nunlikely to focus on the remote prospect of an erroneous\ndisclosure order, let alone on the timing of a possible\nappeal. Whether or not immediate collateral order ap\npeals are available, clients and counsel must account for\nthe possibility that they will later be required by law to\ndisclose their communications for a variety of reasons\u2014for\nexample, because they misjudged the scope of the privi\nlege, because they waived the privilege, or because their\ncommunications fell within the privilege\u2019s crime-fraud\nexception. Most district court rulings on these matters\ninvolve the routine application of settled legal principles.\nThey are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen they rest on factual determinations for which appel\nlate deference is the norm. See, e.g., Richardson-Merrell,\n472 U. S., at 434 (\u201cMost pretrial orders of district judges\nare ultimately affirmed by appellate courts.\u201d); Reise v.\nBoard of Regents, 957 F. 2d 293, 295 (CA7 1992) (noting\nthat \u201calmost all interlocutory appeals from discovery\norders would end in affirmance\u201d because \u201cthe district court\npossesses discretion, and review is deferential\u201d). The\nbreadth of the privilege and the narrowness of its excep\ntions will thus tend to exert a much greater influence on\nthe conduct of clients and counsel than the small risk that\nthe law will be misapplied.2\n   Moreover, were attorneys and clients to reflect upon\ntheir appellate options, they would find that litigants\nconfronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege\nruling have several potential avenues of review apart from\ncollateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\ncourt to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an\ninterlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). The\npreconditions for \u00a71292(b) review\u2014\u201ca controlling question\nof law,\u201d the prompt resolution of which \u201cmay materially\nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation\u201d\u2014are\nmost likely to be satisfied when a privilege ruling involves\na new legal question or is of special consequence, and\ndistrict courts should not hesitate to certify an interlocu\ntory appeal in such cases. Second, in extraordinary cir\ncumstances\u2014i.e., when a disclosure order \u201camount[s] to a\njudicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d\nor otherwise works a manifest injustice\u2014a party may\npetition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\nCheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S.\n367, 390 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Perhaps the situation would be different if district courts were sys\n\ntematically underenforcing the privilege, but we have no indication\nthat this is the case.\n\f10         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted); see also Firestone, 449 U. S., at 378\u2013379, n. 13.3\nWhile these discretionary review mechanisms do not\nprovide relief in every case, they serve as useful \u201csafety\nvalve[s]\u201d for promptly correcting serious errors. Digital\nEquipment, 511 U. S., at 883.\n   Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a\ndisclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions. Dis\ntrict courts have a range of sanctions from which to\nchoose, including \u201cdirecting that the matters embraced in\nthe order or other designated facts be taken as established\nfor purposes of the action,\u201d \u201cprohibiting the disobedient\nparty from supporting or opposing designated claims or\ndefenses,\u201d or \u201cstriking pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2)(i)\u2013(iii). Such sanctions allow a\nparty to obtain postjudgment review without having to\nreveal its privileged information. Alternatively, when the\ncircumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a\nnoncomplying party in contempt. The party can then\nappeal directly from that ruling, at least when the con\ntempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punish\nment. See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Firestone, 449 U. S., at\n377; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 328\n(1940); see also Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at 140\u2013155.\n   These established mechanisms for appellate review not\nonly provide assurances to clients and counsel about the\nsecurity of their confidential communications; they also go\na long way toward addressing Mohawk\u2019s concern that,\nabsent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client\nprivilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe\nhardship. Mohawk is no doubt right that an order to\ndisclose privileged material may, in some situations, have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 Mohawk itself petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for a writ of manda\n\nmus.

But the same can\nbe said about many categories of pretrial discovery orders\nfor which collateral order appeals are unavailable. As\nwith these other orders, rulings adverse to the privilege\nvary in their significance; some may be momentous, but\nothers are more mundane. Section 1292(b) appeals, man\ndamus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate\nimmediate review of some of the more consequential at\ntorney-client privilege rulings. Moreover, protective or\nders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing\nsensitive information. That a fraction of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege may nevertheless harm indi\nvidual litigants in ways that are \u201conly imperfectly repara\nble\u201d does not justify making all such orders immediately\nappealable as of right under \u00a71291. Digital Equipment,\n511 U. S., at 872.\n  In short, the limited benefits of applying \u201cthe blunt,\ncategorical instrument of \u00a71291 collateral order appeal\u201d to\nprivilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify\nthe likely institutional costs. Id., at 883. Permitting\nparties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all\nadverse attorney-client rulings would unduly delay the\nresolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden\nthe Courts of Appeals. See Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at\n123 (\u201cRoutine appeal from disputed discovery orders\nwould disrupt the orderly progress of the litigation, swamp\nthe courts of appeals, and substantially reduce the district\ncourt\u2019s ability to control the discovery process.\u201d); cf. Cun\nningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209 (1999)\n(expressing concern that allowing immediate appeal as of\nright from orders fining attorneys for discovery violations\nwould result in \u201cthe very sorts of piecemeal appeals and\nconcomitant delays that the final judgment rule was de\nsigned to prevent\u201d). Attempting to downplay such con\ncerns, Mohawk asserts that the three Circuits in which\nthe collateral order doctrine currently applies to adverse\n\f12         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprivilege rulings have seen only a trickle of appeals. But\nthis may be due to the fact that the practice in all three\nCircuits is relatively new and not yet widely known. Were\nthis Court to approve collateral order appeals in the attor\nney-client privilege context, many more litigants would\nlikely choose that route. They would also likely seek to\nextend such a ruling to disclosure orders implicating many\nother categories of sensitive information, raising an array\nof line-drawing difficulties.4\n                             C\n   In concluding that sufficiently effective review of ad\nverse attorney-client privilege rulings can be had without\nresort to the Cohen doctrine, we reiterate that the class of\ncollaterally appealable orders must remain \u201cnarrow and\nselective in its membership.\u201d Will, 546 U.

This\nadmonition has acquired special force in recent years with\nthe enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, \u201cnot\nexpansion by court decision,\u201d as the preferred means for\ndetermining whether and when prejudgment orders\nshould be immediately appealable.

Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514\nU. S. 35, 48 (1995); ante, at 13 (quoting Swint, supra;\nciting Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198,\n210 (1999)). It is for that reason that I do not join the\nremainder of the Court\u2019s analysis.\n   The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is a matter\nthe Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 9, and that Congress has addressed not only in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71291 and 1292, but also in the Rules Enabling\nAct amendments to which the Court refers. See ante, at\n12\u201313 (citing \u00a7\u00a72072\u20132074). The Court recognizes that\nthese amendments \u201cdesignat[e] rulemaking, \u2018not expan\nsion by court decision,\u2019 as the preferred means of deter\nmining whether and when prejudgment orders should be\n\f2        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

Because that designation is entitled to our\nfull respect, and because the privilege order here is not on\nall fours with orders we previously have held to be appeal\nable under the collateral order doctrine, see Cohen v.\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), I\nwould affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment on the\nground that any \u201cavenue for immediate appeal\u201d beyond\nthe three avenues addressed in the Court\u2019s opinion must\nbe left to the \u201crulemaking process.\u201d Ante, at 13; see ante,\nat 9\u201312 (discussing certification under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71292(b), petitions for mandamus, and appeals from con\ntempt orders).\n   We need not, and in my view should not, further justify\nour holding by applying the Cohen doctrine, which\nprompted the rulemaking amendments in the first place.\nIn taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a\njudicial policy that we for many years have criticized and\nstruggled to limit. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8); Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n345, 349 (2006); Sell v. United States, 539 U.

S.\n495, 498\u2013501 (1989); Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486\nU. S. 517, 527 (1988). The Court\u2019s choice of analysis is the\nmore ironic because applying Cohen to the facts of this\ncase requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus\npotentially prejudice, the very matters it says would bene\nfit from \u201cthe collective experience of bench and bar\u201d and\nthe \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that rulemaking provides.\nAnte, at 13.\n   \u201cFinality as a condition of review is an historic charac\nteristic of federal appellate procedure\u201d that was incorpo\nrated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself\nhas \u201cdeparted from only when observance of it would\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

S. 323, 324\u2013325 (1940). Until\n1949, this Court\u2019s view of the appellate jurisdiction statute\nreflected this principle and the statute\u2019s text. See, e.g.,\nCatlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding\nthat \u00a7128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291)\nlimits review to decisions that \u201cen[d] the litigation on the\nmerits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute\nthe judgment\u201d). Cohen changed all that when it an\nnounced that a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral orders that do\nnot meet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless\nmay be immediately appealable if they satisfy certain\ncriteria that show they are \u201ctoo important to be denied\nreview.\u201d 337 U. S., at 546.\n  Cohen and the early decisions applying it allowed \u00a71291\nappeals of interlocutory orders concerning the posting of a\nbond, see id., at 545\u2013547, the attachment of a vessel in\nadmiralty, see Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombi\nana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U. S. 684, 688\u2013689 (1950), and\nthe imposition of notice costs in a class action, see Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 170\u2013172 (1974). As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion notes, later decisions sought to narrow\nCohen lest its exception to \u00a71291 \u201c \u2018 swallow\u2019 \u201d the final\njudgment rule. Ante, at 5 (quoting Digital Equipment,\nsupra, at 868); see generally Coopers & Lybrand v. Live\nsay, 437 U. S. 463, 467\u2013468 (1978). The Court has ad\nhered to that narrowing approach, principally by raising\nthe bar on what types of interests are \u201cimportant enough\u201d\nto justify collateral order appeals. See, e.g., Will, supra, at\n352\u2013353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically\nwill be \u201cimportant\u201d enough to justify Cohen review only\nwhere \u201csome particular value of a high order,\u201d such as\n\u201chonoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi\nciency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State\u2019s digni\ntary interests,\u201d is \u201cmarshaled in support of the interest in\navoiding trial\u201d and the Court determines that denying\n\f4         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nreview would \u201cimperil\u201d that interest); Digital Equipment,\nsupra, at 878\u2013879 (noting that appealability under Cohen\nturns on a \u201cjudgment about the value of the interests that\nwould be lost through rigorous application of a final judg\nment requirement,\u201d and that an interest \u201cqualifies as\n\u2018important\u2019 in Cohen\u2019s sense\u201d if it is \u201cweightier than the\nsocietal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of\nfinal judgment principles\u201d). As we recognized last Term,\nhowever, our attempts to contain the Cohen doctrine have\nnot all been successful or persuasive. See Ashcroft, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]s a general matter, the collateral\norder doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of\nthe criteria set out in Cohen\u201d). In my view, this case pre\nsents an opportunity to improve our approach.\n   The privilege interest at issue here is undoubtedly\nimportant, both in its own right and when compared to\nsome of the interests (e.g., in bond and notice-cost rulings)\nwe have held to be appealable under Cohen. Accordingly,\nthe Court\u2019s Cohen analysis does not rest on the privilege\norder\u2019s relative unimportance, but instead on its effective\nreviewability after final judgment. Ante, at 8\u201312. Al\nthough I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, I see\ntwo difficulties with this approach. First, the Court em\nphasizes that the alternative avenues of review it dis\ncusses (which did not prove adequate in this case) would\nbe adequate where the privilege ruling at issue is \u201cparticu\nlarly injurious or novel.\u201d Ante, at 9. If that is right, and it\nseems to me that it is, then the opinion raises the question\nwhy such avenues were not also adequate to address the\norders whose unusual importance or particularly injurious\nnature we have held justified immediate appeal under\nCohen. See, e.g., Sell, supra, at 177. Second, the facts of\nthis particular case seem in several respects to undercut\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the benefits of collateral order\nreview \u201ccannot justify the likely institutional costs.\u201d Ante,\n\f                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nat 11.* The Court responds that these case-specific argu\nments miss the point because the focus of the Cohen\nanalysis is whether the \u201centire category\u201d or \u201cclass of\nclaims\u201d at issue merits appellate review under the collat\neral order doctrine. Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is exactly right, and illustrates what in\ncreasingly has bothered me about making this kind of\nappealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.\nThe exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the\nrealities of each case before it to generalized conclusions\nabout the \u201clikely\u201d costs and benefits of allowing an excep\ntion to the final judgment rule in an entire \u201cclass of cases.\u201d\nThe Court concedes that Congress, which holds the consti\ntutional reins in this area, has determined that such value\njudgments are better left to the \u201ccollective experience of\nbench and bar\u201d and the \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that\nrulemaking provides. Ante, at 13. This determination is\nentitled to our full respect, in deed as well as in word.\nAccordingly, I would leave the value judgments the Court\nmakes in its opinion to the rulemaking process, and in so\ndoing take this opportunity to limit\u2014effectively, predicta\nbly, and in a way we should have done long ago\u2014the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court concludes, for example, that in most cases final judgment\nreview of an erroneous privilege ruling will suffice to vindicate the\ninjured party\u2019s rights because the appellate court can vacate the\nadverse judgment and remand for a new trial in which the protected\nmaterial is excluded. Ante, at 8. But this case appears to involve one of\nthe (perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not\nbe sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order already\nhas had \u201cimplications beyond the case at hand,\u201d namely, in the sepa\nrate class action in Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., No. 4:04\u2013CV\u2013\n0003\u2013HLM (ND Ga.). Ante, at 11. The Court also concludes that the\n\u201clikely institutional costs\u201d of allowing collateral order review would\noutweigh its benefits because, inter alia, such review would \u201cneedlessly\nburden the Courts of Appeals.\u201d Ibid. But as the Court concedes, it\nmust speculate on this point because the three Circuits that allow\nCohen appeals of privilege rulings have not been overwhelmed.

Argued October 14, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nIllinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property used to\n   facilitate a drug crime, permits police to seize the property without a\n   warrant, and allows the State to keep the property nearly five\n   months before beginning judicial forfeiture proceedings. Respon\n   dents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law,\n   brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of\n   the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\n   Due Process Clause. The District Court dismissed the case based on\n   Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from\n   that precedent and ruled for respondents. This Court granted certio\n   rari to review the Seventh Circuit\u2019s due process determination, but\n   at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property\n   disputes between the parties had been resolved.\nHeld:\n    1. The case is moot. The Constitution permits this Court to decide\n legal questions only in the context of actual \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControver\n sies,\u201d Art. III, \u00a72, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of\n review, not just when the complaint is filed, Preiser v. Newkirk, 422\n U. S. 395, 401. Here there is no longer any actual controversy re\n garding ownership or possession of the underlying property. There is\n no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified\n class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit\n within the category of cases that are \u201ccapable of repetition\u201d while\n \u201cevading review.\u201d Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.\n Pp. 4\u20136.\n    2.

Where mootness is the result of\n    settlement rather than happenstance, however, the losing party for\n    feits the equitable remedy of vacatur. U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.\n    Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25. This case more closely re\n    sembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.\n    In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by volun\n    tarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation. Here,\n    the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no\n    significant role in the termination of plaintiffs\u2019 state-court forfeiture\n    proceedings. Plaintiffs\u2019 forfeiture cases took place with no procedural\n    link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substan\n    tive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court\u2019s knowledge,\n    no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.\n    This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary prac\n    tice and order vacatur.

S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71; United States v. Von Neu\nmann, 474 U. S. 242 (1986); United States v. $8,850, 461\nU. S. 555 (1983). At the time of oral argument, however,\nwe learned that the underlying property disputes have all\nended. The State has returned all the cars that it seized,\nand the individual property owners have either forfeited\nany relevant cash or have accepted as final the State\u2019s\nreturn of some of it. We consequently find the case moot,\nand we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case to that court with instruc\u00ad\ntions to dismiss. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340\nU. S. 36, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.\nShapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac\u00ad\ntice 941\u2013942 (9th ed. 2007).\n\f2                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal\nproperty (including cars and cash) used \u201cto facilitate\u201d a\ndrug crime. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a7570/505(a)(6) (West\n2008). It permits a police officer to seize that property\nwithout a warrant where (1) the officer has \u201cprobable\ncause to believe\u201d the property was so used and (2) a \u201cwar\u00ad\nrantless seizure . . . would be reasonable\u201d in the circum\u00ad\nstances. \u00a7570/505(b). When an officer has seized property\nwithout a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency\nmust notify the State\u2019s Attorney within 52 days of the\nseizure; the State\u2019s Attorney must notify the property\nowner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45\ndays; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the\nState\u2019s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings\nwithin yet a further 45 days. See ch. 725, \u00a7\u00a7150/5\u2013150/6.\nThus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly\nfive months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings\u2014\nduring which time the statute permits the State to keep\nthe car or cash within its possession.\n   On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents\nor \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) brought this federal civil rights action\nagainst defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent\nof the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County\nState\u2019s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call\nthe \u201cState\u2019s Attorney\u201d). See Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71983. Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Ed\u00ad\nmanuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in\n2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars\nwithout a warrant. See Complaint \u00b625, App. 34a (Smith,\nseizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., \u00b626, at 34a (Perez, seizure\non Mar. 8, 2006); id., \u00b627, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on\nApr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Class Certification \u00b68,\nat 39a. The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk\nYunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006\npolice had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

See Complaint \u00b628, at 34a\u201335a (Waldo, seizure\non Jan. 20, 2006); id., \u00b629, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on\nSept. 26, 2006); id., \u00b630, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July\n2006); Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Class Certification \u00b68, at 39a.\nThe plaintiffs added that the police department still had\ncustody of their property. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b624\u201330, at\n34a\u201335a. They claimed that the failure of the State to\nprovide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\nDue Process Clause. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71. And\nthey asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class ac\u00ad\ntion, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a\nprompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare\nthat the hearing must take place within 10 days of any\nseizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants\u2019 current practice\nof keeping the property in custody for a longer time with\u00ad\nout a judicial determination of probable cause. See Com\u00ad\nplaint \u00b636, App. 36a.\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the\nground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that\n\u201cthe Constitution does not require any procedure prior to\nthe actual forfeiture proceeding.\u201d Jones v. Takaki, 38\nF. 3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).\nOn February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the\nmotion to dismiss. It also denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for\nclass certification. The plaintiffs appealed.\n   On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal\nin the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F. 3d 834.\nIt reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.\nId., at 836\u2013839. It held that \u201cthe procedures set out in\u201d\nthe Illinois statute \u201cshow insufficient concern for the due\nprocess right of the plaintiffs.\u201d Id., at 838. And it added\nthat, \u201cgiven the length of time which can result between\nthe seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner\nto contest the seizure under\u201d Illinois law, \u201csome sort of\nmechanism to test the validity of the retention of the\nproperty is required.\u201d Ibid. The Court of Appeals re\u00ad\n\f4                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded\nthe case for further proceedings. Id., at 839. Its mandate\nissued about seven weeks thereafter.\n   On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review\nthe Seventh Circuit\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d determination. The\nCourt of Appeals then recalled its mandate. The parties\nfiled briefs in this Court. We then recognized that\nthe case might be moot, and we asked the parties to ad\u00ad\ndress the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral\nargument.\n   At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that\nthere was no longer any dispute about ownership or pos\u00ad\nsession of the relevant property. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(State\u2019s Attorney); id., at 56\u201357 (plaintiffs). The State had\nreturned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.\nSee id., at 5. Two of the plaintiffs had \u201cdefaulted,\u201d appar\u00ad\nently conceding that the State could keep the cash. Ibid.\nAnd the final plaintiff and the State\u2019s Attorney agreed\nthat the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash\nat issue. Id., at 5, 56\u201357. As counsel for the State\u2019s Attor\u00ad\nney told us, \u201c[T]hose cases are over.\u201d Id., at 5.\n                               II\n   The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal\nquestions only in the context of actual \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cContro\u00ad\nversies.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72. An \u201c \u2018actual controversy\nmust be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\ntime the complaint is filed.\u2019 \u201d Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S.\n395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.\n452, 459, n. 10 (1974)). In this case there is no longer any\nactual controversy between the parties about ownership or\npossession of the underlying property.\n   The State\u2019s Attorney argues that there is a continuing\ncontroversy over damages. We concede that the plaintiffs\nfiled a motion in the District Court seeking damages. But\nthe plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissued its opinion. And, after this Court granted certio\u00ad\nrari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the\ncase away from the District Court before the District\nCourt could respond to the motion. Thus, we have before\nus a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, not damages.\n  The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of\na class. And a class might well contain members who\ncontinue to dispute ownership of seized property. But that\nfact is beside the point. The District Court denied the\nplaintiffs\u2019 class certification motion. The plaintiffs did not\nappeal that denial. Hence the only disputes relevant here\nare those between these six plaintiffs and the State\u2019s\nAttorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and\nthose disputes are now over.           United States Parole\nComm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980) (\u201cA named\nplaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press\nthe appeal on the merits until a class has been properly\ncertified\u201d).\n  The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawful\u00ad\nness of the State\u2019s hearing procedures. But that dispute is\nno longer embedded in any actual controversy about the\nplaintiffs\u2019 particular legal rights. Rather, it is an abstract\ndispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs\nany more than it affects other Illinois citizens. And a\ndispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from\nany concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the\nscope of the constitutional words \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControver\u00ad\nsies.\u201d See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S.\n472, 477 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246\n(1971) (per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300\nU. S. 227, 241 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653\n(1895).\n  We can find no special circumstance here that might\nwarrant our continuing to hear the case. We have some\u00ad\ntimes heard attacks on practices that no longer directly\n\f6                   ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naffect the attacking party, but are \u201ccapable of repetition\u201d\nwhile \u201cevading review.\u201d        See, e.g., Federal Election\nComm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 462\n(2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.\n498, 515 (1911). Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing\nsuggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again\nprove subject to the State\u2019s seizure procedures. See Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (\u201c[T]he capable\u00ad\nof-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situa\u00ad\ntions, and generally only where the named plaintiff can\nmake a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected\nto the alleged illegality\u201d); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S.\n312, 318\u2013319 (1974) (per curiam). And in any event, since\nthose who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices\nmight bring damages actions, the practices do not \u201cevade\nreview.\u201d See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft,\n436 U. S. 1, 8\u20139 (1978) (damages claim saves case from\nmootness). Consequently, the case is moot. See, e.g.,\nPreiser, supra, at 403\u2013404; Mills, supra, at 658.\n                             III\n   It is less easy to say whether we should order the judg\u00ad\nment below vacated. The statute that enables us to vacate\na lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is\nflexible, allowing a court to \u201cdirect the entry of such ap\u00ad\npropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such\nfurther proceedings to be had as may be just under the\ncircumstances.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72106; see also U. S. Bancorp\nMortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21\n(1994). Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the\nlower court judgment in a moot case because doing so\n\u201cclears the path for future relitigation of the issues be\u00ad\ntween the parties,\u201d preserving \u201cthe rights of all parties,\u201d\nwhile prejudicing none \u201cby a decision which . . . was only\npreliminary.\u201d Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.\n   In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe would not do so. We said that, \u201c[w]here mootness\nresults from settlement\u201d rather than \u201c \u2018happenstance,\u2019 \u201d the\n\u201closing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy . . .\n[and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable\nremedy of vacatur.\u201d 513 U. S., at 25. The plaintiffs, point\u00ad\ning out that the State\u2019s Attorney agreed to return all three\ncars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at\nleast four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp\u2019s\n\u201csettlement\u201d exception.\n   In our view, however, this case more closely resembles\nmootness through \u201chappenstance\u201d than through \u201csettle\u00ad\nment\u201d\u2014at least the kind of settlement that the Court\nconsidered in Bancorp. Bancorp focused upon a bank\u00ad\nruptcy-related dispute that involved a legal question\nwhether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a\ndebtor\u2019s Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied\nupon what the debtor said was a special exception (called\nthe \u201cnew value exception\u201d) to ordinary creditor priority\nrules. Id., at 19\u201320. The parties contested that legal issue\nin the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order to the Federal District\nCourt; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of\nAppeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court.\nId., at 20. While the case was pending here, the parties\nsettled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the\ncourt where the case originated)\u2014including their differ\u00ad\nences on this particular contested legal point. Ibid. They\nagreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would\nconstitute a settlement that mooted the federal case. Ibid.\n   Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settle\u00ad\nment that mooted the case, this Court did not vacate the\nlower court\u2019s judgment. The Court\u2019s reason for leaving the\nlower court\u2019s judgment in place was that mootness was not\na result of \u201cthe vagaries of circumstance.\u201d Id., at 25.\nRather the party seeking review had \u201ccaused the mootness\n\f8                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby voluntary action.\u201d Id., at 24 (emphasis added). By\nvirtue of the settlement, that party had \u201cvoluntarily for\u00ad\nfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal\nor certiorari.\u201d Id., at 25. Hence, compared to mootness\ncaused by \u201chappenstance,\u201d considerations of \u201cequity\u201d and\n\u201cfairness\u201d tilted against vacatur. Id., at 25\u201326.\n   Applying these principles to the case before us, we\nconclude that the terminations here fall on the \u201chappen\u00ad\nstance\u201d side of the line. The six individual cases proceeded\nthrough a different court system without any procedural\nlink to the federal case before us. To our knowledge (and\nwe have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in\nthose cases raised the procedural question at issue here.\nRather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of\nstate substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeit\u00ad\nable or not? And court docket sheets suggest that the six\nstate cases terminated on substantive grounds in the\nordinary course of such state proceedings. In the three\nautomobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the\nproceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40\nmonths after the seizures, a long enough time for the\nState to have investigated the matters and to have deter\u00ad\nmined (after the termination of any related criminal pro\u00ad\nceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to\nclaim the cars. See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet\nImpala, No. 2006\u2013COFO\u2013000296 (Cook County, IL)\n(Brunston\u2019s car returned on July 27, 2009); People v.\nSmith, No. 2006\u2013COFO\u2013000036 (Cook County, IL)\n(Smith\u2019s car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999\nChevrolet Malibu, No. 2006\u2013COFO\u2013000288 (Cook County,\nIL) (Perez\u2019s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007). In the remain\u00ad\ning contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily\ndismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long\nenough time for the State to have weighed the evidence\nand found a compromise settlement appropriate on the\nmerits.

The disparate dates at which\nplaintiffs\u2019 forfeiture proceedings terminated\u201411, 14, 27,\nand 40 months after the seizures\u2014indicate that the\nState\u2019s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plain\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 state-court cases, either with each other or with\nplaintiffs\u2019 federal civil rights case. Cf. Munsingwear, 340\nU. S., at 39\u201340 (stating that a lower court judgment would\nhave been vacated even though an action of the party\nseeking review had brought about the mootness because\nthat action\u2014a commodity being decontrolled by Executive\nOrder\u2014was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v.\nMunsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).\n   For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this\nfederal case played no significant role in the termination\nof the separate state-court proceedings. This conclusion is\nreinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware\nof Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.\nIndeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral\nargument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to\navoid review in this case played no role at all in producing\nthe state case terminations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u201311, 33\u201338.\nAnd if the presence of this federal case played no role in\ncausing the termination of those state cases, there is not\npresent here the kind of \u201cvoluntary forfeit[ure]\u201d of a legal\nremedy that led the Court in Bancorp to find that consid\u00ad\nerations of \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cequity\u201d tilted against vacatur.\n   We consequently conclude that we should follow our\nordinary practice, thereby \u201cclear[ing] the path for future\nrelitigation of the issues.\u201d Munsingwear, 340 U.

Following the teaching of our\ndecision in U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nPartnership, 513 U. S. 18 (1994), I would apply the general\nrule against vacating appellate judgments that have be\ncome moot because the parties settled.\n   Bancorp set forth the basic principles for determining\nwhether to vacate a case that has become moot. The\noverriding concern is equitable: \u201cFrom the beginning we\nhave disposed of moot cases in the manner \u2018 \u201cmost conso\nnant to justice\u201d . . . in view of the nature and character of\nthe conditions which have caused the case to become\nmoot.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 24 (quoting United States v.

SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are\nnot merely the property of private litigants . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n26 (quoting Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v.\nU. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 40 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting)). Hence, we will typically vacate a judgment\nwhen the party seeking review has been \u201cfrustrated by the\nvagaries of circumstance\u201d or \u201cwhen mootness results from\nunilateral action of the party who prevailed below.\u201d Ban\ncorp, 513 U. S., at 25. But we will typically decline to\nvacate when \u201cthe party seeking relief from the judgment\nbelow caused the mootness by voluntary action,\u201d id., at 24,\nincluding action taken in good faith and in conjunction\nwith the opposing party. Even when \u201crespondent agreed\nto [a] settlement that caused the mootness,\u201d it remains\n\u201cpetitioner\u2019s burden, as the party seeking relief from the\nstatus quo of the appellate judgment, to demonstrate not\nmerely equivalent responsibility for the mootness, but\nequitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of\nvacatur.\u201d Id., at 26. \u201c[M]ootness by reason of settlement\ndoes not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.\u201d Id.,\nat 29.\n  In my view, the Court has misapplied these principles.\nTo be sure, the \u201csettlement\u201d between the parties in this\ncase might be distinguished from the more conventional\nsettlement reached by the parties in Bancorp. And we\nhave no evidence to suggest that petitioner returned re\nspondents\u2019 property prior to the conclusion of our review\nwith the purpose or expectation of manufacturing moot\nness. Nevertheless, petitioner\u2019s decision to return the\nautomobiles when it did appears to have been legally\ndiscretionary, as was the \u201ccompromise settlement\u201d that it\nreached with respondent Waldo regarding her cash, ante,\nat 8. In light of petitioner\u2019s purposive and voluntary\naction that caused the mootness\u2014along with its failure to\nalert us to the relevant facts or to explain why vacatur\nwould serve the public interest\u2014I believe it has failed to\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 26.\n   There was a third option for disposing of this case: We\ncould have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvi\ndently granted. Like denying the petition in the first\nplace, that disposition would have preserved the judgment\nbelow. At the time we granted certiorari on February 23,\n2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying\nproperty disputes for five of the six named respondents.\nSee ante, at 4, 8\u20139. It was entirely predictable that the\nfinal settlement would soon follow. Moreover, the briefing\nin this case has revealed a disagreement over basic de\nscriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not\npassed upon below. Compare Brief for Petitioner 60\u201366\nwith Brief for Respondents 41\u201344. And, of course, we have\nno way of knowing how the District Court would have\napplied the Court of Appeals\u2019 remand order, which left it\ngreat discretion to \u201cfashion appropriate procedural relief\u201d\n\u201cwith the help of the parties.\u201d Smith v. City of Chicago,\n524 F. 3d 834, 838 (CA7 2008). It has become clear that\nthe Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case;\nthe improvidence of our grant provides an additional\nreason why we should not vacate the work product of our\ncolleagues on the Court of Appeals.\n   I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion\nand from its judgment.\n\f"}

Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nThe Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful\n  and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man\n  dates arbitration of \u201cminor disputes\u201d before panels composed of two\n  representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as\n  tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610\u2013613. To\n  supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad\n  justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep\n  resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153\n  First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers\n  must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining\n  agreement (hereinafter CBA), see \u00a7153 First (i), a stage known as\n  \u201con-property\u201d proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties\n  must attempt settlement \u201cin conference\u201d between representatives of\n  the carrier and the grievant-employee. \u00a7152 Second, Sixth. The RLA\n  contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,\n  but does not \u201csupersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con\n  ferences) . . . between the parties,\u201d \u00a7152 Sixth; in common practice\n  the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation.

Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in\n  addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in \u00a7153\n  First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola\n  tions.\n      After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)\n  charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union\n  (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the\n  CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis\n  putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.\n  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un\n  ion sought arbitration before the NRAB\u2019s First Division. Both parties\n  filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc\n  ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily\n  knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the\n  Board\u2019s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes\n  Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to \u201cset forth all\n  relevant, argumentative facts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e). Just prior to\n  the hearing, one of the arbitration panel\u2019s industry representatives\n  objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of\n  conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The\n  referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The\n  Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue\n  was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected\n  before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci\n  sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record\n  could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec\n  tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was\n  not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un\n  ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the\n  Board\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the\n  \u201csingle question\u201d at issue was whether written documentation of the\n  conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to\n  NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi\n  site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the\n  Union\u2019s primary, statute-based argument\u2014that the panel erred in\n  ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\u2014it reversed on the\n  ground that the NRAB\u2019s proceedings were incompatible with due\n  process.\nHeld:\n    1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union\u2019s appeal under\n a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court\n granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside\n\f                    Cite as: 558 U.

But so long as a respondent does not\n\u201cseek to modify the judgment below,\u201d true here, the respondent may\n\u201crely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the\njudgment.\u201d Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh\nCircuit understood that the Union had pressed \u201cstatutory and consti\ntutional\u201d arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on\na \u201csingle question\u201d: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?\nAnswering this \u201csingle question\u201d in the negative, the Seventh Circuit\neffectively resolved the Union\u2019s core complaint. Because nothing in\nthe Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference\nminor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the\n\u201csingle question\u201d leaves no doubt about the Union\u2019s entitlement, in\naccord with \u00a7153 First (q), to vacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given\nthis statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in\nthis case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse\nquential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here\nenables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as\nBoard decisions, over matters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Pp. 10\u2013\n12.\n   2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting\nand processing claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the\nBoard\u2019s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on\nthe false premise that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear them, the NRAB\npanel failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress\nplaced] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q).\nPp. 12\u201317.\n      (a) Not all mandatory \u201cprescriptions, however emphatic, \u2018are . . .\nproperly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510. Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers\nto a tribunal\u2019s \u201c \u2018power to hear a case,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018can never be forfeited or\nwaived.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 514. In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule\u201d does not\nreduce a tribunal\u2019s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily \u201cforfeited if\nthe party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\u201d Kon\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held\nnonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina\ntion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju\nrisdictional character of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107(a)\u2019s time limitation for fil\ning a notice of appeal. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.

R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting \u00a7153 First (i)).\n  When a CBA\u2019s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to\n  the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the\n  conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in\n  \u00a7152, the RLA\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section, and not moored to the\n  NRAB\u2019s \u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d set out in \u00a7153\n  First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more \u201cju\n  risdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic\n  tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is\n  not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc\n  ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that\n  NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic\n  tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels\u2019 jurisdiction,\n  surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,\n  NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter. Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (b) Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to\n  require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, sub\n  mission of proof of conferencing. Instructions on party submissions\n  are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has\n  recognized that conferencing may not be a \u201cquestion in dispute,\u201d and\n  when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.\n  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented\n  \u201cdata\u201d supporting the employee\u2019s grievance, 29 CFR \u00a7301(d)\u2014\n  evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.\n  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.\n  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties\u2019 right to order for themselves\n  the conference procedures they will follow.

In each case,\nthe panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a\npanel member, unprompted by the parties, was \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional\u201d in character and therefore commanded threshold\ndismissal.\n   The panel\u2019s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.\nCongress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but\nCongress alone controls the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.

Congress therefore amended the Act in\n1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor\ndisputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs\nbefore panels composed of two representatives of labor and\ntwo of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie\u00ad\nbreaker.

The governing\nprovision, still in force, allows parties aggrieved by an\nNRAB panel order to petition for court review. 45 U. S. C.\n\u00a7153 First (q) (2006 ed.). The provision instructs that\n      \u201c[o]n such review, the findings and order of the divi\u00ad\n      sion shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the\n      order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or re\u00ad\n      manded . . . , for failure of the division to comply with\n      the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order\n      to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the\n      scope of the division\u2019s jurisdiction, or for fraud or\n      corruption by a member of the division making the\n      order.\u201d\nCourts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision\nprecludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due\nprocess violations. Compare, e.g., Shaffi v. PLC British\nAirways, 22 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available),\nand Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F. 2d 839, 847\n(CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.

Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an\nemployee\u2019s claim. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB\non the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee\u2019s\nequitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process. We\nsummarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered\nthe plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it. Id., at 92. We\nadded that if the Court of Appeals \u201cintended to reverse the [NRAB\u2019s]\nrejection of [the employee\u2019s] equitable tolling argument,\u201d then the court\nhad exceeded the bounds \u00a7153 First (q) placed on its review authority.\nId., at 93.

(hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its em\u00ad\nployees with disciplinary violations. Their union, the\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen\n(hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pur\u00ad\nsuant to the CBA. The Union asserts that, following\nexhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties confer\u00ad\nenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at\nargument that at least two of the disputes were confer\u00ad\nenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Dissatisfied with the outcome of\nthe on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration\nbefore the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the\nCarrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous\nsubmissions in the five cases. In each submission, the\nUnion included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the\nhearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating\nto the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance\nproceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a\ndisputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar\u00ad\nily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con\u00ad\nferred, and the Board\u2019s governing rule instructs carriers\nand employees to \u201cset forth all relevant, argumentative\nfacts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e).\n   On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the\nemployees\u2019 claims, one of the industry representatives on\nthe arbitration panel raised an objection.

On his own initiative, unprompted by the\nCarrier, and in executive session, the industry representa\u00ad\ntive asserted that the on-property record included no proof\nof conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em\u00ad\nbraced the panel member\u2019s objection. The neutral referee\ninformed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear\u00ad\ning, allowing the Union \u201cto submit evidence that confer\u00ad\n\f  8   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v.

The Union\ndid so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and corre\u00ad\nspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing\nin each of the five cases. E.g., Panel Decision 67a\u201368a.\nFrom its first notice of the objection, however, the Union\nmaintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un\u00ad\ntimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had\nnot objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.\nE.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review \u00b6\u00b622, 29, 30, 54.\n  On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of\nconferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci\u00ad\nsions, dismissed the petitions for want of \u201cauthority to\nassume jurisdiction over the claim[s].\u201d Panel Decision\n72a.

The Carrier\u2019s\nsubmissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on\nfailure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,\nthey concluded, under a \u201cwell settled principle governing\nthe Board\u2019s deliberations,\u201d the Carrier had forfeited the\nissue.

As the Court of\nAppeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12\u201317,\nnothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the\nobligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer\u00ad\nencing. That being so, the \u201cunavoidable\u201d conclusion,\nfollowing from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \u201canswer [to] the key\nquestion,\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in \u00a7153\nFirst (q)\u2019s words, failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.\u201d The Carrier,\nalthough it sought a different outcome, was quite right to\n\u201curg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory\nclaim before the constitutional one.\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750.\n   In short, a negative answer to the \u201csingle question\u201d\nidentified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about\nthe Union\u2019s entitlement, in accord with \u00a7153 First (q), to\nvacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given this statutory\nground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this\ncase, and no warrant to answer a question that may be\nconsequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in\n\f  12 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n\u00a7153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing\ncourt set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility\nwith due process? An answer to that question must await\na case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In\nthis case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to\naddress a matter of some importance: We can reduce\nconfusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over\nmatters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Recognizing that the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d has been used\nby courts, including this Court, to convey \u201cmany, too\nmany, meanings,\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ\nment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against\nprofligate use of the term. Not all mandatory \u201cprescrip\u00ad\ntions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub\u00ad\nject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em\u00ad\nphasized, refers to a tribunal\u2019s \u201cpower to hear a case,\u201d a\nmatter that \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived.\u201d Id., at 514\n(quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630\n(2002)). In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule, . . . even if\nunalterable on a party\u2019s application,\u201d does not reduce the\nadjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily \u201cfor\u00ad\nfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise\nthe point.\u201d Kontrick v.

See also id., at 37 (\u201cThe statutory\nreview provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to\nraise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be\nmeritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .\u201d).\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U.

We have also held nonjurisdictional\nand forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employ\u00ad\ners who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546\nU. S., at 503, 515\u2013516.

In contrast, relying on a long\nline of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\nwe have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time\nlimitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U.

S. C. \u00a7152 Second, Sixth. See supra, at 4\u20135, and n. 3.\nThis obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike\nbut, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi\u00ad\ncatory authority of the Board.\n   The Board\u2019s jurisdiction extends to \u201call disputes between\ncarriers and their employees \u2018growing out of grievances or\nout of the interpretation or application of agreements\nconcerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .\u2019 \u201d\nSlocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240\n(1950) (quoting \u00a7153 First (i)). True, the RLA instructs\nthat, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute \u201cshall\n\f  14 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbe handled in the usual manner up to and including the\n[designated] chief operating officer.\u201d \u00a7153 First (i). And\nwhen the CBA\u2019s grievance procedure has not been fol\u00ad\nlowed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objection\u00ad\nable as premature.\n   The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is\nindependent of the CBA process. Rather, the conference\nrequirement is stated in the \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section of\nthe RLA, \u00a7152, a section that is not moored to the\n\u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d of the NRAB\nset out next in \u00a7153 First. Rooted in \u00a7152 and often in\u00ad\nformal in practice, see supra, at 4\u20135, conferencing is surely\nno more \u201cjurisdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the\nEEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if\nthe requirement to conference is not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then\nfailure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be\nof that genre. See Part III\u2013B, infra.\n   In defense of the Board\u2019s characterization of conferenc\u00ad\ning and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points\nto the NRAB\u2019s Circular One procedural regulations, see\nsupra, at 3\u20134, which provide: \u201cNo petition shall be consid\u00ad\nered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat\u00ad\nter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of\nthe [RLA].\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.2(b). But that provision, as\nother prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing\nrule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules\nof jurisdictional dimension. See 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153 First (v)\n(authorizing the NRAB to \u201cadopt such rules as it deems\nnecessary to control proceedings before the respective\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The RLA states, in \u00a7152 First, a general duty \u201cto settle all disputes,\u201d\n\nand, in \u00a7152 Second, a more specific duty to \u201cconference.\u201d These provi\u00ad\nsions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as\nminor. They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which\nthe NRAB has no jurisdiction. \u00a7181.

And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely\ncontested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad\u00ad\njourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular\nOne does not exclude such a sensible solution.\n   The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support\ncharacterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the\nNRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its\npanels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that\nauthority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously\naddressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.\nAward No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although\ncharacterizing the conferencing requirement as \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d said that \u201c[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to\navail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to\ndo so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris\u00ad\ndiction.\u201d Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.\n5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.\n28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U.

Award No. 23867, p. 5\n(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem\u00ad\nedy for lack of conferencing is to \u201cdismiss th[e] claim with\u00ad\nout prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional\ndefect.\u201d That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.\nCf. Steel Co., 523 U.

Moreover, the\nBoard itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a\n\u201cquestion in dispute.\u201d It has counseled parties submitting\njoint exhibits \u201cto omit documents that are unimportant\nand/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for exam\u00ad\nple . . . letters requesting a conference (assuming that is\nnot an issue in the dispute).\u201d NRAB Instructions Sheet,\nJoint Exh.

It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor\nthe Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified\nconferencing as a \u201cquestion in dispute.\u201d See supra, at 7.\n   It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly\npresented \u201cdata . . . in support of [the] employee[\u2019s] [griev\u00ad\nance],\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d)\u2014evidence the carrier had no\nopportunity to consider prearbitration. A contrary rule\nwould sandbag the carrier. But conferencing is not a fact\nbearing on the merits of a grievance. Indeed, there may be\nno disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferenc\u00ad\ning, as the Union believed to be the case here. Moreover,\nthe RLA respects the right of the parties to order for\nthemselves the conference procedures they will follow.\nSee 45 U. S. C. \u00a7152 Sixth (\u201c[N]othing in this chapter shall\nbe construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement\n(as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.\u201d).

KINDLER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08\u2013992.      Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nRespondent Kindler was convicted of capital murder in Pennsylvania\n  state court, and the jury recommended a death sentence. Kindler\n  filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but\n  before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury\u2019s death\n  recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada. The state trial\n  court subsequently dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because\n  of his escape. Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and\n  held him in jail pending extradition. But before Kindler could be\n  transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time re\n  maining at large for more than two years. He was eventually recap\n  tured and transferred to the United States. Once back in this coun\n  try, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial\n  court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the mo\n  tions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive for\n  feiture law. Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court\n  erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions,\n  but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler\u2019s claims\n  were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.\n  Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will\n  not review a claim rejected by a state court \u201cif the decision of [the\n  state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the\n  federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. The District Court nonetheless\n  granted Kindler\u2019s habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive\n  forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review\n  of Kindler\u2019s habeas claims. The Third Circuit affirmed, and the\n  Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari. It argued that the Third\n\f2                         BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically in\n    adequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and\n    the Commonwealth sought review of that holding. The Court\n    granted that petition.\nHeld: A state procedural rule is not automatically \u201cinadequate\u201d under\n the adequate state ground doctrine\u2014and therefore unenforceable on\n federal habeas review\u2014because the state rule is discretionary rather\n than mandatory. The question whether a state procedural ruling is\n adequate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.\n 362, 375. This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking\n whether the state rule was \u201cfirmly established and regularly fol\n lowed.\u201d Id., at 376. A discretionary state procedural rule can serve\n as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the ap\n propriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal\n claim in some cases but not others. A contrary holding would pose an\n unnecessary dilemma for the States: They could preserve flexibility\n by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\n the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments. Or\n States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding\n such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in\n applying the rules. If forced to choose, many States would opt for\n mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.\n That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are\n often desirable. The federal system, for example, often grants the\n trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main\n event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking. The\n States have followed suit. Given the federalism and comity concerns\n motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context,\n see Coleman, supra, at 730, this Court should not disregard discre\n tionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State\n and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal\n courts.

In a harbinger of\nthings to come, Kindler escaped. Commonwealth v. Kin\ndler, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A. 2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 513\nU. S. 933 (1994).\n  Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with\nburglary. He was released on bail. Bernstein agreed to\ntestify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans. At\nabout 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw at\ntacked Bernstein outside his apartment. Kindler beat\nBernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and\nShaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.\nBernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move,\nand Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their\nnearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the\nDelaware River. At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block\naround Bernstein\u2019s neck and dumped him in the water. A\nforensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of\ndrowning and massive head injuries. 536 Pa., at 236\u2013239,\n639 A. 2d, at 5\u20136.\n  Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital\nmurder. The jury recommended a death sentence, and\nKindler filed postverdict motions. Id., at 230\u2013231, 639\nA. 2d, at 2.\n  But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could\nconsider the motions or the jury\u2019s death recommendation,\nKindler escaped. Ibid. In an organized effort to saw\nthrough the external prison bars with smuggled tools,\nKindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the\nprison and headed for Canada. See Commonwealth v.\nKindler, 554 Pa. 513, 517\u2013518, and n. 4, 722 A. 2d 143,\n145, and n. 4 (1998).\n  Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26,\n1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate bur\nglary offenses. The United States sought Kindler\u2019s return,\nbut an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to\nhand over anyone likely to face execution. See Kindler v.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

He\neven appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among\nother things, how he had escaped and why he chose Can\nada: \u201cI knew there was no death penalty here.\u201d CTV\nNational News: Joseph Kindler\u2019s Fate Unresolved (Cana\ndian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Canadian authorities ulti\nmately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and\nagreed to extradite Kindler. Kindler, supra, at 231, 639\nA. 2d, at 2.\n  But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian\ncustody, he escaped again. On the night of October 23,\n1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of\nthe jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the\nskylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof,\nwhere he stood 175 feet above ground. Armed with 13\nstories\u2019 worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely\nrappelled down the side of the jail. (A fellow escapee was\nnot as lucky\u2014the sheets ripped on his way down, causing\nhim to fall 50 feet to his death.) Kindler, 554 Pa., at 517\u2013\n519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.\n  This time, Kindler remained on the lam for more than\ntwo years, until he was featured on the popular television\nshow, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d Characterizing Kindler\nas \u201can above average criminal\u201d and \u201ca chess player who\nunderstands when to make his move,\u201d the show asked\nviewers for information to help capture him. America\u2019s\nMost Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at\n10:01. Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified\nCanadian authorities, who arrested him in September\n1988. 554 Pa., at 519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.\n  Kindler again fought extradition. On September 16,\n1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of\nCanada rejected Kindler\u2019s efforts. See Kindler, 2 S. C. R.\n779. That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler\n\f4                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto the United States. Kindler v. Horn, 291 F. Supp. 2d\n323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).\n   In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court\nhad dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because of his\noriginal escape. Once back in the United States, Kindler\nfiled a motion to reinstate those challenges to his convic\ntion and sentence. The trial court denied the reinstate\nment motion, holding that the trial court judge who had\ndismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused\nhis discretion. In October 1991\u2014more than seven years\nafter the jury\u2019s death recommendation\u2014the court formally\nimposed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Kindler,\nNo. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App.\n66\u201370.\n   Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in\ndeclining to address the merits of his postverdict motions.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler, 536\nPa., at 232\u2013234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. That court recognized\nthat \u201ctrial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive\nstatus, . . . have every right to fashion an appropriate\nresponse[,] which can include the dismissal of pending\npost-verdict motions.\u201d Id., at 233, 639 A. 2d, at 3. The\ncourt then determined that the trial court\u2019s decision to\ndismiss Kindler\u2019s claims fell within its authority: The\n\u201cdismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable\nresponse to Appellant\u2019s \u2018flouting\u2019 of the authority of the\ncourt.\u201d Id., at 233\u2013234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. Under Pennsyl\nvania\u2019s fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kin\ndler\u2019s case therefore came to it \u201cwithout any allegations of\nerror (direct or collateral) preserved.\u201d Id., at 234, 639\nA. 2d, at 4.\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless con\nducted the \u201climited review\u201d mandated for death sentences\nunder Pennsylvania law. Under that review, the court\nwas required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport the conviction of first-degree murder and at least\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\none aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not\nexcessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or\nprejudice. Id., at 234\u2013235, 639 A. 2d, at 4. Satisfied that\nKindler\u2019s conviction met these standards, the court af\nfirmed his conviction and sentence. We denied certiorari.\nKindler v. Pennsylvania, 513 U. S. 933 (1994).\n   On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected\nKindler\u2019s claims. That court held that the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court had already ruled that Kindler\u2019s escape\nforfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence\nthat Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. Com\nmonwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App.\n183, 187\u2013188. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.\nKindler, 554 Pa., at 514, 722 A. 2d, at 143.\n   Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The District\nCourt determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not\nprovide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kin\ndler\u2019s habeas claims. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 340\u2013343. The\nDistrict Court then proceeded to address the merits,\ngranting Kindler\u2019s petition on the grounds that he was\nsentenced based on jury instructions that were unconsti\ntutional under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988),\nand that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggra\nvating factor at sentencing. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 346\u2013351,\n357\u2013358. The court rejected Kindler\u2019s ineffective assis\ntance of counsel claim. Id., at 356.\n   The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began by recog\nnizing that \u201c[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied\nin the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal\nhabeas review even if state courts are willing to occasion\nally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief\nwhere the rule would otherwise apply.\u201d Kindler v. Horn,\n542 F. 3d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then con\nsidered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place\nat the time of Kindler\u2019s first escape: \u201cPennsylvania courts\nhad discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who\n\f6                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been returned to custody before an appeal was initi\nated or dismissed. . . . Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture\nrule was not \u2018firmly established\u2019 and therefore was not an\nindependent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to\nbar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal\ncourt.\u201d Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F. 3d 675, 684\u2013\n686 (CA3 1996)). The court thus determined that \u201cthe\nstate trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post\nverdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that, under\nDoctor, Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive waiver law did not pre\nclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the\nclaims raised in Kindler\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d 542 F. 3d, at\n80. Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed\nwith the District Court on the improper aggravating factor\nclaim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on\nhis Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542\nF. 3d, at 80\u201387.\n   The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing\nthat the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that state discre\ntionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with\nthe holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted\nthis Court\u2019s review. Pet. for Cert. 6\u201311. Kindler coun\ntered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the\nThird Circuit\u2019s holding. Relying on the court\u2019s citation of\nthe Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit\ndid not hold that discretionary state rules are automati\ncally inadequate; rather the court determined that the\nstate courts applied \u201ca new and different rule from that in\nexistence at the time of the alleged default.\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 3. It was that new rule, Kindler maintained,\nthat the Third Circuit found inadequate. Ibid.\n   We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for certiorari.\n556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide\nwhether discretionary procedural rulings are automati\ncally inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009) \n          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II \n\n    The question whether a state procedural ruling is ade\nquate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU. S. 362, 375 (2002). We have framed the adequacy\ninquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was\n\u201c \u2018firmly established and regularly followed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 376\n(quoting James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984)).\n    We hold that a discretionary state procedural rule can\nserve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.\nNothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for\npurposes of the adequate state ground doctrine. To the\ncontrary, a discretionary rule can be \u201cfirmly established\u201d\nand \u201cregularly followed\u201d\u2014even if the appropriate exercise\nof discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim\nin some cases but not others. See Meltzer, State Court\nForfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1140\n(1986) (\u201c[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an\nimportant independent category under the inadequate\nstate ground doctrine\u201d).\n    A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma\nfor the States: States could preserve flexibility by granting\ncourts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\nthe cost of undermining the finality of state court judg\nments. Or States could preserve the finality of their\njudgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the\ncost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.\n    We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would\nopt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come\nwith plenary federal review. See, e.g., Brief for State of\nCalifornia et al. as Amici Curiae 19; Brief for Criminal\nJustice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 14. That\nwould be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary\nrules are often desirable. In some circumstances, for\nexample, the factors facing trial courts \u201care so numerous,\nvariable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules\nwould be more likely to impair [the trial judge\u2019s] ability to\n\f8                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just\nresult.\u201d United States v. McCoy, 517 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA7)\n(Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 895 (1975); see also\nFriendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J.\n747, 760\u2013761 (1982). The result would be particularly\nunfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the\nopportunity to argue that a procedural default should be\nexcused through the exercise of judicial discretion. See\nHenry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 463, n. 3 (1965)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf, in order to insulate its deci\nsions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip\nitself of the discretionary power to differentiate between\ndifferent sets of circumstances, the [adequate state\nground] rule operates in a most perverse way\u201d).\n   It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the federal system\noften grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his\nringside perspective at the \u201c \u2018main event\u2019 \u201d offers him a\ncomparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977); cf. United States v. Poynter,\n495 F. 3d 349, 351\u2013352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to\nvalue discretionary rules as much as the Federal Govern\nment does. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16\u201317 (citing various state discretionary proce\ndural rules). In light of the federalism and comity con\ncerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in\nthe habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730, it\nwould seem particularly strange to disregard state proce\ndural rules that are substantially similar to those to which\nwe give full force in our own courts. Cf. Francis v. Hen\nderson, 425 U. S. 536, 541\u2013542 (1976). Even stranger to\ndo so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State,\nand all at one fell swoop.\n   We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial\u2014\nso uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the\npoint before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201331.\nRather than defending the question on which we granted\n\f                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertiorari\u2014whether discretionary rules are automatically\ninadequate\u2014Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts\ndid not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead ap\nplied a new rule mandating dismissal. Such a mandatory\ndismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past\ndiscretionary practice, and thus does not provide an ade\nquate state ground to bar his federal claims. We leave it\nto the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any\nothers Kindler may have preserved, on remand.\n  For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to\nreject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to\nundertake \u201c[a] new effort to state a standard for inade\nquacy.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25. Amici supporting the\nCommonwealth join in that request. See Brief for Crimi\nnal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6\u201310. We\ndecline that invitation as well. The procedural default at\nissue here\u2014escape from prison\u2014is hardly a typical proce\ndural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for\nproviding broad guidance on the adequate state ground\ndoctrine.\n  If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the\nquestion we granted certiorari to decide is narrow. An\nswering that question is sufficient unto the day.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U.

The appar\nent difficulty the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nfound in accepting the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nprocedural bar conclusion, however, invites this further\ncomment.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine cannot be applied\nwithout consideration of the purposes it is designed to\nserve. By refraining from deciding cases that rest on an\nadequate and independent state ground, federal courts\nshow proper respect for state courts and avoid rendering\nadvisory opinions. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\n(1983). The claimed adequate and independent state\nground at issue in this case is a state procedural rule. We\nhave not allowed state courts to bar review of federal\nclaims by invoking new procedural rules without adequate\nnotice to litigants who, in asserting their federal rights,\nhave in good faith complied with existing state procedural\nlaw. \u201cNovelty in procedural requirements cannot be per\nmitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those\n\f2                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nwho, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindi\ncation in state courts of their federal constitutional\nrights.\u201d NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.\n449, 457\u2013458 (1958). We have also been mindful of the\ndanger that novel state procedural requirements will be\nimposed for the purpose of evading compliance with a\nfederal standard. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.\nFlowers, 377 U. S. 288, 293\u2013302 (1964).\n   Neither of these concerns applies here. First, no one\ncould seriously entertain the notion that Kindler acted in\n\u201cjustified reliance\u201d when he fled beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe Pennsylvania courts. Even if a hypothetical escapee\nstudiously examined the case law before making an in\nformed decision that flight was worth it, that is not the\nreliance the law should be required to consider. There is\nno justification for an unlawful escape, which \u201coperates as\nan affront to the dignity of [a] court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d Or\ntega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 246 (1993).\nAnd if some prior court rulings allowed a former escapee\nto reinstate forfeited claims, there is no convincing reason\nto say a future escapee is entitled to similar treatment.\nNor is there any indication that the Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania adopted its forfeiture rule out of any hostil\nity toward legitimate constitutional claims.\n   It is most doubtful that, in light of its underlying pur\nposes, the adequate state ground doctrine ought to prevent\na State from adopting, and enforcing, a sensible rule that\nthe escaped felon forfeits any pending postverdict motions.\nThe law is entitled to protect the regularity and predict\nability of its own processes, and its own interest in the\nprompt adjudication of disputed issues, by imposing a rule\nof waiver quite without regard to some notion of express or\nconstructive reliance by the one who escapes. And if that\nprinciple had not been fully explicated in prior decisions, it\nseems to me that the State can establish a new baseline\nwithout later having its procedural bar ignored by the\n\f                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nfederal courts. This should be true even if the principles\nbarring the postverdict motions are first elaborated in the\ninstant case.\n  The process of elaborating, defining, and then shaping a\nState\u2019s decisional law after considering the competing\narguments in a specific case rests on this premise: Novel\nfacts and circumstances may disclose principles that,\nwhile consistent with the logic and rationality the law\nseeks and in that sense predictable, still have not yet been\ndefined with precision in earlier cases. This is the dy\nnamic of the case system we rely upon to explain the law.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine ought not to fore\nclose the case process in the separate States. A too\nrigorous or demanding insistence that procedural re\nquirements be established in all of their detail before they\ncan be given effect in federal court would deprive the\nStates of the case law decisional dynamic that the Judici\nary of the United States finds necessary and appropriate\nfor the elaboration of its own procedural rules. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). Save where\nthere is exclusive jurisdiction or federal supremacy, a\nproper constitutional balance ought not give federal courts\nlatitude in the interpretation and elaboration of its law\nthat it then withholds from the States. There is no sense\nin applying the adequate state ground rule without its\nbeing informed by these principles.\n  Whether the structure of this case either permits or\nrequires consideration of these matters is not clear at this\nstage. In a proper case, however, these concerns should be\naddressed. It seems most doubtful that this Court can or\nshould require federal courts to disregard a state proce\ndural ground that was not in all respects explicit before\nthe case when it was first announced, absent a showing of\na purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.\nAnd this is particularly so when the state procedural\nrequirement arose from the necessity, in new circum\n\f4                   BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nstances, to prevent a travesty of the State\u2019s own respected\nsystem.

STEVENS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013769.     Argued October 6, 2009\u2014Decided April 20, 2010\nCongress enacted 18 U. S. C. \u00a748 to criminalize the commercial crea\n  tion, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. The\n  statute addresses only portrayals of harmful acts, not the underlying\n  conduct. It applies to any visual or auditory depiction \u201cin which a liv\n  ing animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or\n  killed,\u201d if that conduct violates federal or state law where \u201cthe crea\n  tion, sale, or possession takes place,\u201d \u00a748(c)(1). Another clause ex\n  empts depictions with \u201cserious religious, political, scientific, educa\n  tional, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\u201d     \u00a748(b).  The\n  legislative background of \u00a748 focused primarily on \u201ccrush videos,\u201d\n  which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said\n  to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish. Respondent Ste\n  vens was indicted under \u00a748 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.\n  He moved to dismiss, arguing that \u00a748 is facially invalid under the\n  First Amendment. The District Court denied his motion, and Ste\n  vens was convicted. The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and de\n  clared \u00a748 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of\n  protected speech.\nHeld: Section \u00a748 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid un\n der the First Amendment. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically\n unprotected by the First Amendment. Because \u00a748 explicitly regu\n lates expression based on content, it is \u201c \u2018presumptively invalid,\u2019 . . .\n and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.\u201d\n United States v.

S. 568, 572. Depic\n    tions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list. While the\n    prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law,\n    there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting depictions of\n    such cruelty. The Government\u2019s proposed test would broadly balance\n    the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine\n    whether the First Amendment even applies. But the First Amend\n    ment\u2019s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of\n    speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and\n    benefits. The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\n    people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government out\n    weigh the costs. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, distinguished.\n    Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (b) Stevens\u2019s facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.\n    Pp. 9\u201320.\n         (1) In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as\n    overbroad if \u201ca \u2018substantial number\u2019 of its applications are unconsti\n    tutional, \u2018 \u201cjudged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate\n    sweep.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\n    Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6. Stevens claims that common depic\n    tions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of\n    materials subject to \u00a748. The Government does not defend such ap\n    plications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to spe\n    cific types of extreme material. Section 48\u2019s constitutionality thus\n    turns on how broadly it is construed. Pp. 9\u201310.\n         (2) Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.\n    The statute\u2019s definition of a \u201cdepiction of animal cruelty\u201d does not\n    even require that the depicted conduct be cruel. While the words\n    \u201cmaimed, mutilated, [and] tortured\u201d convey cruelty, \u201cwounded\u201d and\n    \u201ckilled\u201d do not. Those words have little ambiguity and should be read\n    according to their ordinary meaning. Section 48 does require that the\n    depicted conduct be \u201cillegal,\u201d but many federal and state laws con\n    cerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard\n    against animal cruelty. For example, endangered species protections\n    restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals. The statute\n    draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.\n         Moreover, \u00a748 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal\n    in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, \u201cre\n    gardless of whether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place\u201d there,\n    \u00a748(c)(1). Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the\n    ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the\n    same conduct is unlawful. This greatly expands \u00a748\u2019s scope, because\n    views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to\n\f                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncruelty vary widely from place to place. Hunting is unlawful in the\nDistrict of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national\nmarket for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand\nfor crush videos or animal fighting depictions. Because the statute\nallows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,\n\u00a748(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that\nis sold in the Nation\u2019s Capital. Those seeking to comply with the law\nface a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate ju\nrisdictions. Pp. 11\u201315.\n     (3) Limiting \u00a748\u2019s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal\nfighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, re\nquires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute\u2019s exceptions\nclause. The statute only exempts material with \u201cserious\u201d value, and\n\u201cserious\u201d must be taken seriously. The excepted speech must also fall\nwithin one of \u00a748(b)\u2019s enumerated categories. Much speech does not.\nFor example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional\nin nature. The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading\nthat results in the statute\u2019s banning only the depictions the Govern\nment would like to ban.\n     Although the language of \u00a748(b) is drawn from the Court\u2019s deci\nsion in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the exceptions clause does\nnot answer every First Amendment objection. Under Miller, \u201cseri\nous\u201d value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity. But\nMiller did not determine that serious value could be used as a gen\neral precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.\nEven \u201c \u2018wholly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection of free\nspeech.\u2019 \u201d Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25. The First Amend\nment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not\nqualify for \u00a748(b)\u2019s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall\nwithin \u00a748(c)\u2019s broad reach. Pp. 15\u201317.\n     (4) Despite the Government\u2019s assurance that it will apply \u00a748 to\nreach only \u201cextreme\u201d cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconsti\ntutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it\nresponsibly. Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to\navoid constitutional doubt. A limiting construction can be imposed\nonly if the statute \u201cis \u2018readily susceptible\u2019 to such a construction,\u201d\nReno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 884. To read\n\u00a748 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinter\npretation. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     (5) This construction of \u00a748 decides the constitutional question.\nThe Government makes no effort to defend \u00a748 as applied beyond\ncrush videos and depictions of animal fighting. It argues that those\nparticular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or\nare analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the\n\f4                    UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny. But\n    the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depic\n    tions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively\n    protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to \u00a748.\n    Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively\n    impermissible applications of \u00a748 far outnumber any permissible\n    ones. The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited\n    to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would\n    be constitutional. Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substan\n    tially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 19\u201320.\n533 F. 3d 218, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

S. C. \u00a748 to criminalize the\ncommercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depic\ntions of animal cruelty. The statute does not address\nunderlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of\nsuch conduct. The question presented is whether the\nprohibition in the statute is consistent with the freedom of\nspeech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n                            I\n  Section 48 establishes a criminal penalty of up to five\nyears in prison for anyone who knowingly \u201ccreates, sells,\nor possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,\u201d if done \u201cfor\ncommercial gain\u201d in interstate or foreign commerce.\n\u00a748(a).1 A depiction of \u201canimal cruelty\u201d is defined as one\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  statute reads in full:\n  \u201c\u00a748.

In what is referred to\nas the \u201cexceptions clause,\u201d the law exempts from prohibi\ntion any depiction \u201cthat has serious religious, political,\nscientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic\nvalue.\u201d \u00a748(b).\n   The legislative background of \u00a748 focused primarily on\nthe interstate market for \u201ccrush videos.\u201d According to the\nHouse Committee Report on the bill, such videos feature\nthe intentional torture and killing of helpless animals,\nincluding cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters.

The acts depicted in crush videos are\ntypically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by\nall 50 States and the District of Columbia.

Rep., at\n3; accord, Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae\n11.\n   This case, however, involves an application of \u00a748 to\ndepictions of animal fighting. Dogfighting, for example, is\nunlawful in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, see\nBrief for United States 26, n. 8 (listing statutes), and has\nbeen restricted by federal law since 1976.

Among these\nvideos were Japan Pit Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit\nBull Documentary, which include contemporary footage of\ndogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal)\nas well as footage of American dogfights from the 1960\u2019s\nand 1970\u2019s.2 A third video, Catch Dogs and Country Liv\ning, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well\nas a \u201cgruesome\u201d scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic\nfarm pig. 533 F. 3d 218, 221 (CA3 2008) (en banc).

It went on to hold that \u00a748 is not sub\nstantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause suffi\nciently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.\nId., at 71a\u201375a.

The Court of Appeals\nfirst held that \u00a748 regulates speech that is protected by\nthe First Amendment. The Court declined to recognize a\nnew category of unprotected speech for depictions of ani\nmal cruelty, id., at 224, and n. 6, and rejected the Gov\nernment\u2019s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and\nchild pornography, id., at 224\u2013232.\n   The Court of Appeals then held that \u00a748 could not sur\nvive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of pro\ntected speech. Id., at 232. It found that the statute lacked\na compelling government interest and was neither nar\nrowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least\nrestrictive means of doing so. Id., at 232\u2013235. It therefore\nheld \u00a748 facially invalid.\n   In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that\n\u00a748 \u201cmight also be unconstitutionally overbroad,\u201d because\nit \u201cpotentially covers a great deal of constitutionally pro\ntected speech\u201d and \u201csweeps [too] widely\u201d to be limited only\nby prosecutorial discretion.

The claim is not just that Congress may\nregulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First\nAmendment, but that these depictions are outside the\nreach of that Amendment altogether\u2014that they fall into a\n\u201c \u2018First Amendment Free Zone.\u2019 \u201d          Board of Airport\nComm\u2019rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.

Instead,\nthe Government points to Congress\u2019s \u201c \u2018legislative judg\nment that . . . depictions of animals being intentionally\ntortured and killed [are] of such minimal redeeming value\nas to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment protec\ntion,\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 23 (quoting 533 F. 3d, at 243\n(Cowen, J., dissenting)), and asks the Court to uphold the\nban on the same basis. The Government thus proposes\nthat a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered\nunder a simple balancing test: \u201cWhether a given category\nof speech enjoys First Amendment protection depends\nupon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech\nagainst its societal costs.\u201d Brief for United States 8; see\nalso id., at 12.\n   As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage,\nthat sentence is startling and dangerous. The First\nAmendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech does not extend\nonly to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balanc\ning of relative social costs and benefits.         The First\nAmendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\npeople that the benefits of its restrictions on the Govern\nment outweigh the costs. Our Constitution forecloses any\nattempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that\nsome speech is not worth it. The Constitution is not a\ndocument \u201cprescribing limits, and declaring that those\nlimits may be passed at pleasure.\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 178 (1803).\n   To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge\nfrom a vacuum. As the Government correctly notes, this\nCourt has often described historically unprotected catego\nries of speech as being \u201c \u2018of such slight social value as a\nstep to truth that any benefit that may be derived from\nthem is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order\nand morality.\u2019 \u201d R. A. V., supra, at 383 (quoting Chap\nlinsky, supra, at 572). In New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.\n\f8               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n747 (1982), we noted that within these categories of unpro\ntected speech, \u201cthe evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly\noutweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that\nno process of case-by-case adjudication is required,\u201d be\ncause \u201cthe balance of competing interests is clearly\nstruck,\u201d id., at 763\u2013764. The Government derives its\nproposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.\nSee Brief for United States 12\u201313.\n  But such descriptions are just that\u2014descriptive. They\ndo not set forth a test that may be applied as a general\nmatter to permit the Government to imprison any speaker\nso long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary,\nor so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts\nin a statute\u2019s favor.\n  When we have identified categories of speech as fully\noutside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not\nbeen on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis. In\nFerber, for example, we classified child pornography as\nsuch a category, 458 U. S., at 763. We noted that the\nState of New York had a compelling interest in protecting\nchildren from abuse, and that the value of using children\nin these works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult\nactors) was de minimis. Id., at 756\u2013757, 762. But our\ndecision did not rest on this \u201cbalance of competing inter\nests\u201d alone. Id., at 764. We made clear that Ferber pre\nsented a special case: The market for child pornography\nwas \u201cintrinsically related\u201d to the underlying abuse, and\nwas therefore \u201can integral part of the production of such\nmaterials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.\u201d Id.,\nat 759, 761. As we noted, \u201c \u2018[i]t rarely has been suggested\nthat the constitutional freedom for speech and press ex\ntends its immunity to speech or writing used as an inte\ngral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal stat\nute.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 761\u2013762 (quoting Giboney, supra, at 498).\nFerber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recog\nnized, long-established category of unprotected speech,\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand our subsequent decisions have shared this under\nstanding. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990)\n(describing Ferber as finding \u201cpersuasive\u201d the argument\nthat the advertising and sale of child pornography was \u201can\nintegral part\u201d of its unlawful production (internal quota\ntion marks omitted)); Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n535 U.

Maybe there are some categories of speech that\nhave been historically unprotected, but have not yet been\nspecifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\nBut if so, there is no evidence that \u201cdepictions of animal\ncruelty\u201d is among them. We need not foreclose the future\nrecognition of such additional categories to reject the\nGovernment\u2019s highly manipulable balancing test as a\nmeans of identifying them.\n                           III\n  Because we decline to carve out from the First Amend\nment any novel exception for \u00a748, we review Stevens\u2019s\nFirst Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.\n                               A\n   Stevens challenged \u00a748 on its face, arguing that any\nconviction secured under the statute would be unconstitu\ntional. The court below decided the case on that basis, 533\nF. 3d, at 231, n. 13, and we granted the Solicitor General\u2019s\npetition for certiorari to determine \u201cwhether 18 U. S. C. 48\nis facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment,\u201d Pet. for Cert. i.\n\f10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have\nto establish \u201cthat no set of circumstances exists under\nwhich [\u00a748] would be valid,\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481\nU. S. 739, 745 (1987), or that the statute lacks any \u201cplainly\nlegitimate sweep,\u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.\n702, 740, n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nments) (internal quotation marks omitted). Which stan\ndard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that\nwe need not and do not address, and neither Salerno nor\nGlucksberg is a speech case. Here the Government asserts\nthat Stevens cannot prevail because \u00a748 is plainly legiti\nmate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depic\ntions. Deciding this case through a traditional facial\nanalysis would require us to resolve whether these appli\ncations of \u00a748 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.\n   In the First Amendment context, however, this Court\nrecognizes \u201ca second type of facial challenge,\u201d whereby a\nlaw may be invalidated as overbroad if \u201ca substantial\nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in\nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Wash\nington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\nParty, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Stevens argues that \u00a748 applies to com\nmon depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that\nthese depictions constitute the vast majority of materials\nsubject to the statute. Brief for Respondent 22\u201325. The\nGovernment makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as\nconstitutional. Instead, the Government\u2019s entire defense\nof \u00a748 rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly lim\nited to specific types of \u201cextreme\u201d material. Brief for\nUnited States 8. As the parties have presented the issue,\ntherefore, the constitutionality of \u00a748 hinges on how\nbroadly it is construed. It is to that question that we now\nturn.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 The   dissent contends that because there has not been a ruling on\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008). Because \u00a748\nis a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state\ncourt\u2019s authority to interpret its own law.\n   We read \u00a748 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming\nbreadth. To begin with, the text of the statute\u2019s ban on a\n\u201cdepiction of animal cruelty\u201d nowhere requires that the\ndepicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to \u201cany . . .\ndepiction\u201d in which \u201ca living animal is intentionally\nmaimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.\u201d\n\u00a748(c)(1). \u201c[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured\u201d convey\ncruelty, but \u201cwounded\u201d or \u201ckilled\u201d do not suggest any such\nlimitation.\n   The Government contends that the terms in the defini\ntion should be read to require the additional element of\n\u201caccompanying acts of cruelty.\u201d Reply Brief 6; see also Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 17\u201319. (The dissent hinges on the same\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe validity of the statute as applied to Stevens, our consideration of his\nfacial overbreadth claim is premature. Post, at 1, and n. 1, 2\u20133 (opinion\nof ALITO, J.). Whether or not that conclusion follows, here no as-applied\nclaim has been preserved. Neither court below construed Stevens\u2019s\nbriefs as adequately developing a separate attack on a defined subset of\nthe statute\u2019s applications (say, dogfighting videos). See 533 F. 3d 218,\n231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc) (\u201cStevens brings a facial challenge to\nthe statute\u201d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, 74a.

See post, at 1, n. 1. Stevens\u2019s constitutional\nargument is a general one. And unlike the challengers in Washington\nState Grange, Stevens does not \u201crest on factual assumptions . . . that\ncan be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge.\u201d 552\nU.

The Government bases\nthis argument on the definiendum, \u201cdepiction of animal\ncruelty,\u201d cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), and\non \u201c \u2018the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.\u2019 \u201d Reply\nBrief 7 (quoting Williams, 553 U. S., at 294). As that\ncanon recognizes, an ambiguous term may be \u201cgiven more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated.\u201d Ibid. Likewise, an unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined, see\nLeocal, supra, at 11 (interpreting a \u201c \u2018substantial risk\u2019 \u201d of\nthe \u201cus[e]\u201d of \u201cphysical force\u201d as part of the definition of\n\u201c \u2018crime of violence\u2019 \u201d).\n    But the phrase \u201cwounded . . . or killed\u201d at issue here\ncontains little ambiguity. The Government\u2019s opening brief\nproperly applies the ordinary meaning of these words,\nstating for example that to \u201c \u2018kill\u2019 is \u2018to deprive of life.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for United States 14 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1242 (1993)). We agree that\n\u201cwounded\u201d and \u201ckilled\u201d should be read according to their\nordinary meaning. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast\nAir Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004).\nNothing about that meaning requires cruelty.\n    While not requiring cruelty, \u00a748 does require that the\ndepicted conduct be \u201cillegal.\u201d But this requirement does\nnot limit \u00a748 along the lines the Government suggests.\nThere are myriad federal and state laws concerning the\nproper treatment of animals, but many of them are not\ndesigned to guard against animal cruelty. Protections of\nendangered species, for example, restrict even the humane\n\u201cwound[ing] or kill[ing]\u201d of \u201cliving animal[s].\u201d \u00a748(c)(1).\nLivestock regulations are often designed to protect the\nhealth of human beings, and hunting and fishing rules\n(seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight requirements) can\nbe designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations,\nor prevent accidents. The text of \u00a748(c) draws no distinc\ntion based on the reason the intentional killing of an\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Under subsection (c)(1), the depicted\nconduct need only be illegal in \u201cthe State in which the\ncreation, sale, or possession takes place, regardless of\nwhether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place in\n[that] State.\u201d A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs\nafoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into\nanother State where the same conduct is unlawful. This\nprovision greatly expands the scope of \u00a748, because al\nthough there may be \u201ca broad societal consensus\u201d against\ncruelty to animals, Brief for United States 2, there is\nsubstantial disagreement on what types of conduct are\nproperly regarded as cruel. Both views about cruelty to\nanimals and regulations having no connection to cruelty\nvary widely from place to place.\n   In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is\nunlawful. D. C. Munic. Regs., tit. 19, \u00a71560 (2009). Other\njurisdictions permit or encourage hunting, and there is an\nenormous national market for hunting-related depictions\nin which a living animal is intentionally killed. Hunting\nperiodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands\nor millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29, 2008, p. 28, and\nhunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are\nequally popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The citations in the dissent\u2019s appendix are beside the point. The\n\ncited statutes stand for the proposition that hunting is not covered by\nanimal cruelty laws. But the reach of \u00a748 is, as we have explained, not\nrestricted to depictions of conduct that violates a law specifically\ndirected at animal cruelty. It simply requires that the depicted conduct\nbe \u201cillegal.\u201d \u00a748(c)(1). The Government implicitly admits as much,\narguing that \u201cinstructional videos for hunting\u201d are saved by the stat\nute\u2019s exceptions clause, not that they fall outside the prohibition in the\nfirst place.

Nonetheless,\nbecause the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its\nlaws to the rest of the country, \u00a748(a) extends to any\nmagazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as\nthat depiction is sold within the Nation\u2019s Capital.\n   Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewil\ndering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate juris\ndictions. Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga.\nCode Ann. \u00a727\u20133\u20134(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. \u00a729.1\u2013\n519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it,\nOre. Admin.

Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition \u201cany\ndepiction that has serious religious, political, scientific,\neducational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.\u201d The\nGovernment argues that this clause substantially narrows\nthe statute\u2019s reach: News reports about animal cruelty\nhave \u201cjournalistic\u201d value; pictures of bullfights in Spain\nhave \u201chistorical\u201d value; and instructional hunting videos\nhave \u201ceducational\u201d value.

Thus, the Gov\nernment argues, \u00a748 reaches only crush videos, depictions\nof animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see\nBrief for United States 47\u201348), and perhaps other depic\ntions of \u201cextreme acts of animal cruelty.\u201d Id., at 41.\n   The Government\u2019s attempt to narrow the statutory ban,\nhowever, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the\nexceptions clause.

We decline the Government\u2019s invitation\u2014\nadvanced for the first time in this Court\u2014to regard as\n\u201cserious\u201d anything that is not \u201cscant.\u201d (Or, as the dissent\nputs it, \u201c \u2018trifling.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6.) As the Government recog\nnized below, \u201cserious\u201d ordinarily means a good bit more.\nThe District Court\u2019s jury instructions required value that\nis \u201csignificant and of great import,\u201d App. 132, and the\nGovernment defended these instructions as properly\nrelying on \u201ca commonly accepted meaning of the word\n\u2018serious,\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States in No. 05\u20132497 (CA3), p.\n50.\n   Quite apart from the requirement of \u201cserious\u201d value in\n\u00a748(b), the excepted speech must also fall within one of the\nenumerated categories. Much speech does not. Most\nhunting videos, for example, are not obviously instruc\ntional in nature, except in the sense that all life is a les\nson. According to Safari Club International and the Con\ngressional Sportsmen\u2019s Foundation, many popular videos\n\u201chave primarily entertainment value\u201d and are designed to\n\u201centertai[n] the viewer, marke[t] hunting equipment, or\nincreas[e] the hunting community.\u201d Brief for Safari Club\nInternational et al. as Amici Curiae 12.

The Government offers no principled explanation why\nthese depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bull\nfights would be inherently valuable while those of Japa\nnese dogfights are not. The dissent contends that hunting\ndepictions must have serious value because hunting has\nserious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not.\nPost, at 6\u20138.

California,\n413 U. S. 15 (1973), which excepted from its definition of\nobscenity any material with \u201cserious literary, artistic,\npolitical, or scientific value,\u201d id., at 24. See Reply Brief 8,\n9, and n. 5. According to the Government, this incorpora\ntion of the Miller standard into \u00a748 is therefore surely\nenough to answer any First Amendment objection. Reply\nBrief 8\u20139.\n    In Miller we held that \u201cserious\u201d value shields depictions\nof sex from regulation as obscenity. 413 U. S., at 24\u201325.\nLimiting Miller\u2019s exception to \u201cserious\u201d value ensured that\n\u201c \u2018[a] quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book\n[would] not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene\npublication.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 25, n. 7 (quoting Kois v. Wisconsin,\n408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per curiam)). We did not, how\never, determine that serious value could be used as a\ngeneral precondition to protecting other types of speech in\nthe first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks\n\u201creligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value\u201d (let alone serious value), but it\nis still sheltered from government regulation. Even\n\u201c \u2018[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection\nof free speech as fully as do Keats\u2019 poems or Donne\u2019s ser\nmons.\u2019 \u201d Cohen v. California, 403 U.

The Government hits this theme hard, invoking its\nprosecutorial discretion several times. See id., at 6\u20137, 10,\nand n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects\nagainst the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy\nof noblesse oblige. We would not uphold an unconstitu\ntional statute merely because the Government promised to\nuse it responsibly. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 473 (2001).\n   This prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in put\nting faith in government representations of prosecutorial\nrestraint. When this legislation was enacted, the Execu\ntive Branch announced that it would interpret \u00a748 as\ncovering only depictions \u201cof wanton cruelty to animals\ndesigned to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.\u201d See\nStatement by President William J.

The Government\u2019s assurance that it will\napply \u00a748 far more restrictively than its language provides\nis pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the\npotential constitutional problems with a more natural\nreading.\n   Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that\n\u201cambiguous statutory language [should] be construed to\navoid serious constitutional doubts.\u201d FCC v.

It argues that those particu\nlar depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct\nor are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene),\nand that the ban on such speech is narrowly tailored to\nreinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct, prevent\nadditional crime arising from the depictions, or safeguard\npublic mores. But the Government nowhere attempts to\nextend these arguments to depictions of any other activi\nties\u2014depictions that are presumptively protected by the\nFirst Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal\nsanctions of \u00a748.\n   Nor does the Government seriously contest that the\npresumptively impermissible applications of \u00a748 (properly\nconstrued) far outnumber any permissible ones. However\n\u201cgrowing\u201d and \u201clucrative\u201d the markets for crush videos and\ndogfighting depictions might be, see Brief for United\nStates 43, 46 (internal quotation marks omitted), they are\ndwarfed by the market for other depictions, such as hunt\ning magazines and videos, that we have determined to be\nwithin the scope of \u00a748. See supra, at 13\u201314. We there\nfore need not and do not decide whether a statute limited\nto crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal\ncruelty would be constitutional.

S. C. \u00a748, that was enacted not to suppress\nspeech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty\u2014in\nparticular, the creation and commercial exploitation of\n\u201ccrush videos,\u201d a form of depraved entertainment that has\nno social value. The Court\u2019s approach, which has the\npractical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and is\nthus likely to spur a resumption of their production, is\nunwarranted. Respondent was convicted under \u00a748 for\nselling videos depicting dogfights. On appeal, he argued,\namong other things, that \u00a748 is unconstitutional as ap\nplied to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features\nof those videos that might distinguish them from other\ndogfight videos brought to our attention.1 The Court of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent     argued at length that the evidence was insufficient to\nprove that the particular videos he sold lacked any serious scientific,\neducational, or historical value and thus fell outside the exception in\n\u00a748(b). See Brief for Appellant in No. 05\u20132497 (CA3), pp. 72\u201379. He\nadded that, if the evidence in this case was held to be sufficient to take\nhis videos outside the scope of the exception, then \u201cthis case presents\n. . . a situation\u201d in which \u201ca constitutional violation occurs.\u201d Id., at 71.\nSee also id., at 47 (\u201cThe applicability of 18 U.

Today\u2019s decision does not endorse the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes\ndown \u00a748 using what has been aptly termed the \u201cstrong\nmedicine\u201d of the overbreadth doctrine, United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U.

If the question of\noverbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the\npresent record supports the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a748\nbans a substantial quantity of protected speech.\n                             I\n   A party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a\nstatute generally must show that the statute violates the\nparty\u2019s own rights. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767\n(1982). The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine carves\nout a narrow exception to that general rule. See id., at\n768; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.

See, e.g., Board of\nTrustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U.

As we said in Fox, supra, at\n484\u2013485, \u201c[i]t is not the usual judicial practice, . . . nor do\nwe consider it generally desirable, to proceed to an over\nbreadth issue unnecessarily\u2014that is, before it is deter\nmined that the statute would be valid as applied.\u201d Accord,\nNew York State Club Assn., Inc. v.

STEVENS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              II\n   The overbreadth doctrine \u201cstrike[s] a balance between\ncompeting social costs.\u201d Williams, 553 U. S., at 292.\nSpecifically, the doctrine seeks to balance the \u201charmful\neffects\u201d of \u201cinvalidating a law that in some of its applica\ntions is perfectly constitutional\u201d against the possibility\nthat \u201cthe threat of enforcement of an overbroad law [will]\ndete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected\nspeech.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIn order to maintain an appropriate bal\nance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a\nstatute\u2019s overbreadth be substantial, not only in an abso\nlute sense, but also relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legiti\nmate sweep.\u201d Ibid.\n   In determining whether a statute\u2019s overbreadth is sub\nstantial, we consider a statute\u2019s application to real-world\nconduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, e.g., id., at 301\u2013\n302; see also Ferber, supra, at 773; Houston v. Hill, 482\nU. S. 451, 466\u2013467 (1987). Accordingly, we have repeat\nedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the\nburden of demonstrating, \u201cfrom the text of [the law] and\nfrom actual fact,\u201d that substantial overbreadth exists.\nVirginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 122 (2003) (quoting New\nYork State Club Assn., supra, at 14; emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).\nSimilarly, \u201cthere must be a realistic danger that the stat\nute itself will significantly compromise recognized First\nAmendment protections of parties not before the Court for\nit to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.\u201d\nMembers of City Council of Los Angeles v.

Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of\nargument that \u00a748 is valid as applied to these depictions,\nbut the Court concludes that \u00a748 reaches too much pro\ntected speech to survive. The Court relies primarily on\ndepictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depic\ntions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the\nCourt\u2019s examples below.\n                                A\n   I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes,\nphotographs and videos of hunters shooting game are\ncommon. See ante, at 13\u201314. But hunting is legal in all\n50 States, and \u00a748 applies only to a depiction of conduct\nthat is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is\ncreated, sold, or possessed. \u00a7\u00a748(a), (c). Therefore, in all\n50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the\nvast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls\noutside \u00a748\u2019s reach.\n   Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that\n\u00a748 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Co\nlumbia of any depiction of hunting because the District\u2014\nundoubtedly because of its urban character\u2014does not\npermit hunting within its boundaries. Ante, at 13. The\nCourt also suggests that, because some States prohibit a\nparticular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow\nor \u201ccanned\u201d hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal\n(e.g., the \u201csharp-tailed grouse\u201d), \u00a748 makes it illegal for\npersons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depic\ntion of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in\nwhich the hunting took place. See ante, at 12\u201314.\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation is seriously flawed. \u201cWhen a\nfederal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged\nas overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to\navoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to\nsuch a limiting construction.\u201d Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769,\n\f6                   UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nn. 24. See also Williams, supra, at 307 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201c[T]o the extent the statutory text alone is\nunclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes\nit especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to\nascertain the intent of its drafters\u201d).\n   Applying this canon, I would hold that \u00a748 does not\napply to depictions of hunting. First, because \u00a748 targets\ndepictions of \u201canimal cruelty,\u201d I would interpret that\nterm to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal\ncruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, not\nto depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons\nhaving nothing to do with the prevention of animal cru\nelty. See ante, at 12\u201313 (interpreting \u201c[t]he text of \u00a748(c)\u201d\nto ban a depiction of \u201cthe humane slaughter of a stolen\ncow\u201d). Virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty\neither expressly define the term \u201canimal\u201d to exclude\nwildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activi\nties,3 so the statutory prohibition set forth in \u00a748(a) may\nreasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all\nhunting depictions.\n   Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were other\nwise covered by \u00a748(a), I would hold that hunting depic\ntions fall within the exception in \u00a748(b) for depictions that\nhave \u201cserious\u201d (i.e., not \u201ctrifling\u201d4) \u201cscientific,\u201d \u201ceduca\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 See Appendix, infra (citing statutes); B.

While there are certainly\nthose who find hunting objectionable, the predominant\nview in this country has long been that hunting serves\nmany important values, and it is clear that Congress\nshares that view. Since 1972, when Congress called upon\nthe President to designate a National Hunting and Fish\ning Day, see S. J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 86\nStat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations\nextolling the values served by hunting. See Presidential\nProclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama\n2009) (hunting and fishing are \u201cageless pursuits\u201d that\npromote \u201cthe conservation and restoration of numerous\nspecies and their natural habitats\u201d); Presidential Procla\nmation No. 8295, 73 Fed.

Accordingly, I\nwould hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within\nthe exception set out in \u00a748(b).\n  I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in en\nacting \u00a748, had no intention of restricting the creation,\nsale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents of\nthe law made this point clearly. See H. R. Rep. No. 106\u2013\n397, p. 8 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (\u201c[D]epictions of\nordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within\nthe scope of the statute\u201d); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19,\n1999) (Rep. McCollum) (\u201c[T]he sale of depictions of legal\nactivities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal\nunder this bill\u201d); id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (\u201c[L]et us be\nclear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no\nway prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos\u201d). Indeed,\neven opponents acknowledged that \u00a748 was not intended\nto reach ordinary hunting depictions. See ibid. (Rep.\nScott); id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).\n  For these reasons, I am convinced that \u00a748 has no appli\ncation to depictions of hunting. But even if \u00a748 did imper\nmissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunt\ning in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in\nOregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Vir\nginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a\nsharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those iso\nlated applications would hardly show that \u00a748 bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech.\n                             B\n   Although the Court\u2019s overbreadth analysis rests primar\nily on the proposition that \u00a748 substantially restricts the\nsale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites\na few additional examples, including depictions of methods\nof slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows.

First, as explained\nabove, \u00a748 can reasonably be construed to apply only to\ndepictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by\napplicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do\nnot ban the sorts of acts depicted in the Court\u2019s hypotheti\ncals. See, e.g., Idaho Code \u00a725\u20133514 (Lexis 2000) (\u201cNo\npart of this chapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall\nbe construed as interfering with or allowing interference\nwith . . . [t]he humane slaughter of any animal normally\nand commonly raised as food or for production of fiber . . .\n[or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of . . . animal hus\nbandry\u201d); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21\u20134310(b) (2007) (\u201cThe provi\nsions of this section shall not apply to . . . with respect to\nfarm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal\nhusbandry, including the normal and accepted practices\nfor the slaughter of such animals\u201d); Md. Crim. Law Code\nAnn. \u00a710\u2013603 (Lexis 2002) (sections prohibiting animal\ncruelty \u201cdo not apply to . . . customary and normal veteri\nnary and agricultural husbandry practices, including\ndehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit feeding\u201d).\n   Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has\never created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction of the\nslaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of\ndairy cows that would not easily qualify under the excep\ntion set out in \u00a748(b). Depictions created to show proper\nmethods of slaughter or tail-docking would presumably\nhave serious \u201ceducational\u201d value, and depictions created to\nfocus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or\notherwise objectionable would presumably have either\nserious \u201ceducational\u201d or \u201cjournalistic\u201d value or both. In\nshort, the Court\u2019s examples of depictions involving the\ndocking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that\n\u00a748 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial\noverbreadth.\n   The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting, which is\nillegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico, ante, at 15,\n\f10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand I take the Court\u2019s point to be that it would be imper\nmissible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in Puerto\nRico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in\nPuerto Rico.5 But assuming for the sake of argument that\nthis is correct, this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality\nwould not be enough to justify striking down \u00a748 in toto.\n   In sum, we have a duty to interpret \u00a748 so as to avoid\nserious constitutional concerns, and \u00a748 may reasonably\nbe construed not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depic\ntions that the Court finds constitutionally protected.\nThus, \u00a748 does not appear to have a large number of un\nconstitutional applications. Invalidation for overbreadth\nis appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from\nsubstantial overbreadth\u2014judged not just in absolute\nterms, but in relation to the statute\u2019s \u201cplainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Williams, 553 U.

All 50 States\nand the District of Columbia have enacted statutes prohib\niting animal cruelty. See 533 F. 3d, at 223, and n. 4 (citing\nstatutes); H. R. Rep., at 3. But before the enactment of\n\u00a748, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was\nnearly impossible to prosecute. These videos, which \u201c often\nappeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,\u201d id., at\n2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience,\nand \u201cthe faces of the women inflicting the torture in the\nmaterial often were not shown, nor could the location of\nthe place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date\nof the activity be ascertained from the depiction.\u201d Id., at 3.\nThus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to\nidentify the parties responsible for the torture. See Pun\nishing Depictions of Animal Cruelty and the Federal\nPrisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing\nbefore the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Commit\ntee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1999)\n(hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty).

And Congress\u2019 strategy appears to have been\nvindicated. We are told that \u201c[b]y 2007, sponsors of \u00a748\ndeclared the crush video industry dead.

Crush videos\npresent a highly unusual free speech issue because they\nare so closely linked with violent criminal conduct. The\nvideos record the commission of violent criminal acts, and\nit appears that these crimes are committed for the sole\npurpose of creating the videos. In addition, as noted\nabove, Congress was presented with compelling evidence\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the only way of preventing these crimes was to target\nthe sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I can\nnot believe that the First Amendment commands Con\ngress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to\ncontinue.\n   The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber, 458\nU. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court\nthere held that child pornography is not protected speech,\nand I believe that Ferber\u2019s reasoning dictates a similar\nconclusion here.\n   In Ferber, an important factor\u2014I would say the most\nimportant factor\u2014was that child pornography involves the\ncommission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury\nto the \u201cchildren who are made to engage in sexual conduct\nfor commercial purposes.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 753 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Ferber Court repeatedly described\nthe production of child pornography as child \u201cabuse,\u201d\n\u201cmolestation,\u201d or \u201cexploitation.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 749 (\u201cIn\nrecent years, the exploitive use of children in the produc\ntion of pornography has become a serious national prob\nlem\u201d); id., at 758, n. 9 (\u201cSexual molestation by adults is\noften involved in the production of child sexual perform\nances\u201d). As later noted in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coali\ntion, 535 U. S. 234, 249 (2002), in Ferber \u201c[t]he production\nof the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.\u201d\nSee also 535 U.S., at 250 (Ferber involved \u201cspeech that\nitself is the record of sexual abuse\u201d).\n   Second, Ferber emphasized the fact that these underly\ning crimes could not be effectively combated without tar\ngeting the distribution of child pornography. As the Court\nput it, \u201cthe distribution network for child pornography\nmust be closed if the production of material which requires\nthe sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively\ncontrolled.\u201d 458 U. S., at 759. The Court added:\n    \u201c[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature\n\f14               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n     was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not\n     impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pur\n     suing only those who produce the photographs and\n     movies. . . . The most expeditious if not the only prac\n     tical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the\n     market for this material by imposing severe criminal\n     penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise\n     promoting the product.\u201d Id., at 759\u2013760.\nSee also id., at 761 (\u201cThe advertising and selling of child\npornography provide an economic motive for and are thus\nan integral part of the production of such materials\u201d).\n   Third, the Ferber Court noted that the value of child\npornography \u201cis exceedingly modest, if not de minimis,\u201d\nand that any such value was \u201coverwhelmingly out\nweigh[ed]\u201d by \u201cthe evil to be restricted.\u201d Id., at 762\u2013763.\n   All three of these characteristics are shared by \u00a748, as\napplied to crush videos. First, the conduct depicted in\ncrush videos is criminal in every State and the District of\nColumbia. Thus, any crush video made in this country\nrecords the actual commission of a criminal act that in\nflicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and\nultimately results in death. Those who record the under\nlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable,\neither as aiders and abettors or conspirators. And in the\ntight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell\nthe videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit\nmay be similarly culpable. (For example, in some cases,\ncrush videos were commissioned by purchasers who speci\nfied the details of the acts that they wanted to see per\nformed. See H. R. Rep., at 3; Hearing on Depictions of\nAnimal Cruelty 27). To the extent that \u00a748 reaches such\npersons, it surely does not violate the First Amendment.\n   Second, the criminal acts shown in crush videos cannot\nbe prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by\n\u00a748\u2014the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depic\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

The evidence presented to Congress\nposed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploita\ntion of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the crimi\nnal acts that they record. Faced with this evidence, Con\ngress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video\nmarket.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes\nvastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions\nmight conceivably be thought to possess. Section 48\nreaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture;\nthe statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to\nsimulations. And, unlike the child pornography statute in\nFerber or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. \u00a72252, \u00a748(b)\nprovides an exception for depictions having any \u201cserious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value.\u201d\n   It must be acknowledged that \u00a748 differs from a child\npornography law in an important respect: preventing the\nabuse of children is certainly much more important than\npreventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.\nIt was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Ferber did not support the constitutionality\nof \u00a748. 533 F. 3d, at 228 (\u201cPreventing cruelty to animals,\nalthough an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not\nimplicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting\nchildren from physical and psychological harm\u201d). But\nwhile protecting children is unquestionably more impor\ntant than protecting animals, the Government also has a\ncompelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in\ncrush videos.\n   The animals used in crush videos are living creatures\nthat experience excruciating pain. Our society has long\nbanned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the coun\ntry. In Ferber, the Court noted that \u201cvirtually all of the\nStates and the United States have passed legislation\n\f16                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproscribing the production of or otherwise combating \u2018child\npornography,\u2019 \u201d and the Court declined to \u201csecond-guess\n[that] legislative judgment.\u201d6 458 U. S., at 758. Here,\nlikewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing\nthe legislative judgment about the importance of prevent\ning cruelty to animals.\n   Section 48\u2019s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps\nto enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals\ndo not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897\n(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (\u201cThe state has an interest\nin enforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not\nonly being violated, but people are making huge profits\nfrom promoting the violations\u201d); id., at 10685 (May 24,\n1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the\nHouse version of the bill because \u201ccriminals should not\nprofit from [their] illegal acts\u201d). We have already judged\nthat taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.\nSee Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 119 (1991).\n   In short, Ferber is the case that sheds the most light on\nthe constitutionality of Congress\u2019 effort to halt the produc\ntion of crush videos. Applying the principles set forth in\nFerber, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by\nthe First Amendment.\n                               B\n     Application of the Ferber framework also supports the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 In other cases, we have regarded evidence of a national consensus as\n\nproof that a particular government interest is compelling.

STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwho stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the\nvideos themselves, but from the gambling revenue they\ntake in from the fights; the videos \u201cencourage [such] gam\nbling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend\nactual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the\noutcome.\u201d Ibid.; accord, Brief for Center on the Admini\nstration of Criminal Law as Amicus Curiae 12 (\u201cSelling\nvideos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes\nby providing a market for dogfighting while allowing\nactual dogfights to remain underground\u201d); ibid. (\u201cThese\nvideos are part of a \u2018lucrative market\u2019 where videos are\nproduced by a \u2018bare-boned, clandestine staff\u2019 in order to\npermit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetra\ntors of these underlying criminal activities to go unde\ntected\u201d (citations omitted)). Moreover, \u201c[v]ideo documen\ntation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it\nprovides proof of a dog\u2019s fighting prowess\u2014proof de\nmanded by potential buyers and critical to the under\nground market.\u201d Humane Society Brief 9. Such re\ncordings may also serve as \u201c \u2018training\u2019 videos for other fight\norganizers.\u201d Ibid. In short, because videos depicting live\ndogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dog\nfighting subculture, the commercial sale of such videos\nhelps to fuel the market for, and thus to perpetuate the\nperpetration of, the criminal conduct depicted in them.\n   Third, depictions of dogfights that fall within \u00a748\u2019s reach\nhave by definition no appreciable social value. As noted,\n\u00a748(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social\nvalue, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live\nfight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea\nor a message with a modicum of social value would not run\nafoul of the statute.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying criminal\nacts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depic\ntions might be thought to possess.

As a result, dog\n    fights inflict horrific injuries on the participating\n    animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture\n    wounds and broken bones. Losing dogs are routinely\n    refused treatment, beaten further as \u2018punishment\u2019 for\n    the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or incin\n    eration.\u201d Id., at 5\u20136 (footnotes omitted).\n   For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush vid\neos, the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes. As\nwith crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on com\nmerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compel\nling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the\nNation\u2019s criminal laws and preventing criminals from\nprofiting from their illegal activities. See Ferber, supra, at\n757\u2013758; Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 119.\n   In sum, \u00a748 may validly be applied to at least two broad\nreal-world categories of expression covered by the statute:\ncrush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus, the statute has\na substantial core of constitutionally permissible applica\ntions. Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the re\ncord does not show that \u00a748, properly interpreted, bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.\nA fortiori, respondent has not met his burden of demon\nstrating that any impermissible applications of the statute\nare \u201csubstantial\u201d in relation to its \u201cplainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Williams, 553 U.

Argued October 14, 2009\u2014Decided April 21, 2010\nTitle 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 authorizes courts to award a \u201creasonable\u201d attor\n  ney\u2019s fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions. Half of respon\n  dents\u2019 $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the\n  \u201clodestar,\u201d i.e., the number of hours the attorneys and their employ\n  ees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the commu\n  nity. The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work\n  and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would\n  be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience\n  to litigate this case. Awarding fees of about $10.5 million, the Dis\n  trict Court found that the proposed hourly rates were \u201cfair and rea\n  sonable,\u201d but that some of the entries on counsel\u2019s billing records\n  were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were ex\n  cessive. The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 mil\n  lion, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.\nHeld:\n    1. The calculation of an attorney\u2019s fee based on the lodestar may be\n increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary cir\n cumstances. Pp. 5\u201312.\n       (a) The lodestar approach has \u201cachieved dominance in the federal\n courts.\u201d Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 801. Although imper\n fect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that ap\n proximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for\n representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a compa\n rable case; and it is readily administrable, see, e.g., Burlington v. Da\n gue, 505 U. S. 557, 566, and \u201cobjective,\u201d Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n U. S. 424, 433, thereby cabining trial judges\u2019 discretion, permitting\n\f2                         PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    meaningful judicial review, and producing reasonably predictable re\n    sults. Pp. 5\u20137.\n         (b) This Court has established six important rules that lead to\n    today\u2019s decision. First, a \u201creasonable\u201d fee is one that is sufficient to\n    induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meri\n    torious civil rights case, see Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citi\n    zens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565, but that does not pro\n    vide \u201ca form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\n    attorneys,\u201d ibid. Second, there is a \u201cstrong\u201d presumption that the\n    lodestar method yields a sufficient fee. See, e.g., id., at 564. Third,\n    the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount\n    for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may\n    be awarded in \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances. E.g., id., at\n    565. Fourth, \u201cthe lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant\n    factors constituting a \u2018reasonable\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d Id., at 566. An en\n    hancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the\n    lodestar calculation, such as the case\u2019s novelty and complexity, see,\n    e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898, or the quality of an attor\n    ney\u2019s performance, Delaware Valley, supra, at 566. Fifth, the burden\n    of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee\n    applicant. E.g., Blum, 465 U. S., at 901. Sixth, an applicant seeking\n    an enhancement must produce \u201cspecific evidence\u201d supporting the\n    award, id., at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and\n    capable of being reviewed on appeal. Pp. 7\u20139.\n         (c) The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the\n    lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The \u201cstrong\n    presumption\u201d that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in\n    those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately\n    account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a\n    reasonable fee. P. 9.\n         (d) The Court treats the quality of an attorney\u2019s performance and\n    the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant\n    only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior at\n    torney performance and not another factor, such as inferior perform\n    ance by opposing counsel. The circumstances in which superior at\n    torney performance is not adequately taken into account in the\n    lodestar calculation are \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexceptional.\u201d Enhancements\n    should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee\n    would not have been \u201cadequate to attract competent counsel.\u201d Blum,\n    supra, at 897. First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\n    method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately meas\n    ure the attorney\u2019s true market value, as demonstrated in part during\n    the litigation. This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into\n    account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, the trial judge\n  should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking\n  the attorney\u2019s ability to a prevailing market rate. Second, an en\n  hancement may be appropriate if the attorney\u2019s performance includes\n  an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exception\n  ally protracted. In such cases, the enhancement amount must be cal\n  culated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of\n  being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest\n  rate to the qualifying expense outlays. Third, an enhancement may\n  be appropriate where an attorney\u2019s performance involves exceptional\n  delay in the payment of fees. In such a case, the enhancement should\n  be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional de\n  lay in expense reimbursement. Enhancements are not appropriate\n  on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more\n  common. Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increas\n  ingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with\n  a bonus for obtaining specified results. Pp. 9\u201312.\n     2. The District Court did not provide proper justification for the\n  75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case. It commented that the\n  enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropri\n  ate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to\n  more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this\n  is an appropriate figure for the relevant market. The court also em\n  phasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for ex\n  penses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount\n  of the enhancement attributable to this factor. Similarly, the court\n  noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the\n  case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was out\n  side the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on \u00a71988 for\n  fees. Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordi\n  nary and unwarranted delay. And its reliance on the contingency of\n  the outcome contravenes Dague, supra, at 565. Finally, insofar as\n  the court relied on a comparison of counsel\u2019s performance in this case\n  with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a\n  methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. While de\n  termining a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d is within the trial judge\u2019s\n  sound discretion under \u00a71988, that discretion is not unlimited. The\n  judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of\n  a fee determination, including any enhancement.

But as we have also said in prior cases,\nthere is a strong presumption that the lodestar is suffi\ncient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot\nbe used as a ground for increasing an award above the\nlodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identi\nfying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 JUSTICE BREYER would have us answer this question \u201cYes\u201d and then\n\nend the opinion. See post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissent\ning in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar\nand would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The\nissue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is\nfairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has\nbeen extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case.\n\f2                        PERDUE v.

They filed\nthis class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care\nand named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and\nvarious state officials (petitioners in this case). Claiming\nthat deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties\nnear Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional\nand statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.\n   The United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation,\nwhere the parties entered into a consent decree, which the\nDistrict Court approved.

S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest, respondents submitted affidavits asserting that\nthese rates were within the range of prevailing market\nrates for legal services in the relevant market.\n   The other half of the amount that respondents sought\nrepresented a fee enhancement for superior work and\nresults. Affidavits submitted in support of this request\nclaimed that the lodestar amount \u201cwould be generally\ninsufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judg\nment, professional representation and experience\u201d to\nlitigate this case. See, e.g., App. 80. Petitioners objected\nto the fee request, contending that some of the proposed\nhourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were\nexcessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate\nfactors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.\n   The District Court awarded fees of approximately\n$10.5 million. See 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1296 (ND Ga.\n2006). The District Court found that the hourly rates\nproposed by respondents were \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d id., at\n1285, but that some of the entries on counsel\u2019s billing\nrecords were vague and that the hours claimed for many of\nthe billing categories were excessive. The court therefore\ncut the non-travel hours by 15% and halved the hourly\nrate for travel hours. This resulted in a lodestar calcula\ntion of approximately $6 million.\n   The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding\nthat the lodestar calculation did not take into account \u201c(1)\nthe fact that class counsel were required to advance case\nexpenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no\non[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel\nwere not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being\nperformed, and (3) the fact that class counsel\u2019s ability to\nrecover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely\ncontingent on the outcome of the case.\u201d Id., at 1288. The\ncourt stated that respondents\u2019 attorneys had exhibited \u201ca\nhigher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and pro\nfessionalism . . . than the Court has seen displayed by the\n\f4                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\nbench.\u201d Id., at 1289. The court also commented that the\nresults obtained were \u201c \u2018extraordinary\u2019 \u201d and added that\n\u201c[a]fter 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal\njudge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a\nplaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such\na comprehensive scale.\u201d Id., at 1290. The enhancement\nresulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.\n   Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Elev\nenth Circuit affirmed. 532 F. 3d 1209 (2008). The panel\nheld that the District Court had not abused its discretion\nby failing to make a larger reduction in the number of\nhours for which respondents\u2019 attorneys sought reim\nbursement, but the panel commented that it \u201cwould have\ncut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter\nin the first instance\u201d and added that the hourly rates\napproved by the District Court also \u201cappear[ed] to be on\nthe generous side.\u201d Id., at 1220, and n. 2. On the question\nof the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with\neach judge writing a separate opinion.\n   Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent required that the decision of the District Court\nbe affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opin\nions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in\nthis case. He concluded that the quality of the attorneys\u2019\nperformance was \u201cadequately accounted for \u2018either in\ndetermining the reasonable number of hours expended on\nthe litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 1225 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley\nCitizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565\u2013566\n(1986) (Delaware Valley I)). He found that an enhance\nment could not be justified based on delay in the recovery\nof attorney\u2019s fees and reimbursable expenses because such\ndelay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983. And he reasoned that the District Court\nhad contravened our holding in Burlington v. Dague, 505\n\f                    Cite as: 559 U.

S. 557 (1992), when it relied on \u201c \u2018the fact that class\ncounsel\u2019s compensation was totally contingent upon pre\nvailing in this action.\u2019 \u201d 532 F. 3d, at 1226, 1228 (quoting\naffidavit in support of fee request).\n   Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed\nwith Judge Carnes\u2019 view that Eleventh Circuit precedent\nis inconsistent with our decisions. Judge Hill also con\ncurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the\ncorrectness of the prior Circuit precedent.\n   The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the\ndissent of three judges. See 547 F. 3d 1319 (2008). Judge\nWilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehear\ning; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina,\nfiled an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing;\nand Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending,\namong other things, that the District Court, by basing the\nenhancement in large part on a comparison of the per\nformance of respondents\u2019 attorneys with all of the un\nnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his\nprofessional career, had improperly rendered a decision\nthat was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had\nessentially served as a witness in support of the enhance\nment. Id., at 1326\u20131327.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  The general rule in our legal system is that each party\nmust pay its own attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, see Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983), but Congress\nenacted 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 in order to ensure that federal\nrights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that\na prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may re\ncover \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Virtually identical language appears in many of the federal fee\n\nshifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992).\n\f6                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nUnfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress\nmeant by a \u201creasonable\u201d fee, and therefore the task of\nidentifying an appropriate methodology for determining a\n\u201creasonable\u201d fee was left for the courts.\n   One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia\nHighway Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717\u2013719 (CA5\n1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider\nin determining a reasonable fee.4 This method, however,\n\u201cgave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting\nattorney\u2019s fees by reference to a series of sometimes sub\njective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges\nand produced disparate results.\u201d Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 563.\n   An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by\nthe Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadel\nphia v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,\n487 F. 2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F. 2d 102\n(1976), and \u201cachieved dominance in the federal courts\u201d\nafter our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535\nU. S. 789, 801 (2002). \u201cSince that time, \u2018[t]he \u201clodestar\u201d\nfigure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light\nof our fee-shifting jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Dague,\nsupra, at 562).\n   Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has\nseveral important virtues. First, in accordance with our\nunderstanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the\nlodestar looks to \u201cthe prevailing market rates in the rele\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 These factors were: \u201c(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\n\nand difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the\nlegal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney\ndue to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the\nfee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or\nthe circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9)\nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \u2018unde\nsirability\u2019 of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional\nrelationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.\u201d Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 430, n. 3 (1983).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvant community.\u201d Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 895\n(1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had\nbecome widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, the\nlodestar method produces an award that roughly approxi\nmates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have\nreceived if he or she had been representing a paying client\nwho was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second,\nthe lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague,\n505 U. S., at 566; see also Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001); and unlike the John\nson approach, the lodestar calculation is \u201cobjective,\u201d\nHensley, supra, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of\ntrial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and\nproduces reasonably predictable results.\n                             III\n   Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting\nstatutes have established six important rules that lead to\nour decision in this case.\n   First, a \u201creasonable\u201d fee is a fee that is sufficient to\ninduce a capable attorney to undertake the representation\nof a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I,\n478 U. S., at 565 (\u201c[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to\nengage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he\nwill be paid a \u2018reasonable fee,\u2019 the purpose behind the fee\nshifting statute has been satisfied\u201d); Blum, supra, at 897\n(\u201c[A] reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is one that is adequate to\nattract competent counsel, but that does not produce\nwindfalls to attorneys\u201d (ellipsis, brackets, and internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Section 1988\u2019s aim is to en\nforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide \u201ca\nform of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\nattorneys.\u201d Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565.\n   Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is pre\nsumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague,\n\f8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565; Blum,\nsupra, at 897; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801\u2013802.\nIndeed, we have said that the presumption is a \u201cstrong\u201d\none. Dague, supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at\n565.\n   Third, although we have never sustained an enhance\nment of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12, 17, we have repeat\nedly said that enhancements may be awarded in \u201c \u2018rare\u2019 \u201d\nand \u201c \u2018exceptional\u2019 \u201d circumstances. Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 565; Blum, supra, at 897; Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n435.\n   Fourth, we have noted that \u201cthe lodestar figure includes\nmost, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a \u2018rea\nsonable\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee,\u201d Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566,\nand have held that an enhancement may not be awarded\nbased on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calcula\ntion, see Dague, supra, at 562\u2013563; Pennsylvania v. Dela\nware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711,\n726\u2013727 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion);\nBlum, 465 U. S., at 898. We have thus held that the nov\nelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as\na ground for an enhancement because these factors \u201cpre\nsumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable\nhours recorded by counsel.\u201d Ibid. We have also held that\nthe quality of an attorney\u2019s performance generally should\nnot be used to adjust the lodestar \u201c[b]ecause considera\ntions concerning the quality of a prevailing party\u2019s coun\nsel\u2019s representation normally are reflected in the reason\nable hourly rate.\u201d Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566.\n   Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is\nnecessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague,\nsupra, at 561; Blum, 465 U. S., at 901\u2013902.\n   Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must\nproduce \u201cspecific evidence\u201d that supports the award. Id.,\nat 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on \u201cevidence\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat enhancement was necessary to provide fair and rea\nsonable compensation\u201d). This requirement is essential if\nthe lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues,\ni.e., providing a calculation that is objective and capable of\nbeing reviewed on appeal.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject\nany contention that a fee determined by the lodestar\nmethod may not be enhanced in any situation. The lode\nstar method was never intended to be conclusive in all\ncircumstances. Instead, there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d\nthat the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presump\ntion may be overcome in those rare circumstances in\nwhich the lodestar does not adequately take into account a\nfactor that may properly be considered in determining a\nreasonable fee.\n                             B\n   In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the\nquality of an attorney\u2019s performance or the results ob\ntained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an\nenhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a\nplaintiff\u2019s attorney achieves results that are more favor\nable than would have been predicted based on the govern\ning law and the available evidence, the outcome may be\nattributable to superior performance and commitment of\nresources by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Or the outcome may\nresult from inferior performance by defense counsel, unan\nticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable\nrulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or\nsimple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify\nan enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to\nthe extent it can be shown that they are the result of\nsuperior attorney performance. Thus, we need only con\n\f10                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsider whether superior attorney performance can justify\nan enhancement. And in light of the principles derived\nfrom our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circum\nstances in which superior attorney performance is not\nadequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.\nWe conclude that there are a few such circumstances but\nthat these circumstances are indeed \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexcep\ntional,\u201d and require specific evidence that the lodestar\nfee would not have been \u201cadequate to attract competent\ncounsel,\u201d Blum, supra, at 897 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\nmethod used in determining the hourly rate employed in\nthe lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the\nattorney\u2019s true market value, as demonstrated in part\nduring the litigation.5 This may occur if the hourly rate is\ndetermined by a formula that takes into account only a\nsingle factor (such as years since admission to the bar)6 or\nperhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an\nenhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is\ncompensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in\ncases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes.\nBut in order to provide a calculation that is objective and\nreviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney\u2019s\nhourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the\nattorney\u2019s ability to a prevailing market rate.\n   Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Respondents correctly note that an attorney\u2019s \u201cbrilliant insights and\n\ncritical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or\nyears of experience.\u201d Brief for Respondents 14. But as we said in Blum\nv. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984), \u201c[i]n those cases, the special skill\nand experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of\nthe hourly rates.\u201d\n   6 See, e.g., Salazar v. District of Columbia, 123 F. Supp. 2d 8 (DC\n\n2000); Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354 (DC 1983),\naff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 746 F. 2d 4 (CADC 1984).\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney\u2019s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of\nexpenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As\nJudge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to\nrepresent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay\nthe attorney, the attorney presumably understands that\nno reimbursement is likely to be received until the suc\ncessful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and\ntherefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reim\nbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual\ncases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhance\nment may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement\nmust be calculated using a method that is reasonable,\nobjective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as\nby applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying\noutlays of expenses.\n  Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in\nwhich an attorney\u2019s performance involves exceptional\ndelay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to\nbe compensated under \u00a71988 presumably understands\nthat payment of fees will generally not come until the end\nof the case, if at all. See 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of\nCarnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally\nmade \u201ceither by basing the award on current rates or by\nadjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its\npresent value.\u201d Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 282\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not\nrule out the possibility that an enhancement may be ap\npropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the\nface of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is\nunjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, how\never, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a\nmethod similar to that described above in connection with\nexceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for\nexpenses.\n  We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant\nperformance enhancements on the ground that departures\n\f12                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom hourly billing are becoming more common. As we\nhave noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it\nprovides a rough approximation of general billing prac\ntices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual,\nan alternative to the lodestar method may have to be\nfound. However, neither respondents nor their amici\ncontend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown\nthat permitting the award of enhancements on top of the\nlodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the\ngeneral run of cases.\n   We are told that, under an increasingly popular ar\nrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate\nbut receive a bonus if certain specified results are ob\ntained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an\nenhancement such as the one in this case. Brief for Re\nspondents 55\u201357. The analogy, however, is flawed. An\nattorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to\na reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to\nearn a performance bonus is in a position far different\nfrom an attorney in a \u00a71988 case who is compensated at\nthe full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance\nenhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the\nlitigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons\nfor the purposes of administering enhancements, there\nfore, is not appropriate.\n                             V\n  In the present case, the District Court did not provide\nproper justification for the large enhancement that it\nawarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75%\nbut, as far as the court\u2019s opinion reveals, this figure ap\npears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for exam\nple, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the\n100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75%\nrather than 50% or 25% or 10%?\n  The District Court commented that the enhancement\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas the \u201cminimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary\nto reasonably compensate [respondents\u2019] counsel.\u201d 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement\nwas to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than\n$866 per hour,7 and the District Court did not point to\nanything in the record that shows that this is an appro\npriate figure for the relevant market.\n   The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents\u2019\ncounsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses\nand had to wait for reimbursement, id., at 1288, but the\ncourt did not calculate the amount of the enhancement\nthat is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District\nCourt noted that respondents\u2019 counsel did not receive fees\non an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the\ncourt did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the\nrecord that the delay here was outside the normal range\nexpected by attorneys who rely on \u00a71988 for the payment\nof their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court\nprovide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraor\ndinary and unwarranted delay. And the court\u2019s reliance\non the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding\nin Dague. See 505 U. S., at 565.\n   Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a com\nparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the\nperformance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the Dis\ntrict Court did not employ a methodology that permitted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s reliance on the average hourly rate for all of re\nspondents\u2019 attorneys is highly misleading. See post, at 10. In calculat\ning the lodestar, the District Court found that the hourly rate for each\nof these attorneys was \u201ceminently fair and reasonable\u201d and \u201cconsistent\nwith the prevailing market rates in Atlanta for comparable work.\u201d 454\nF.

JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s calculation of an average\nhourly rate for all attorney hours reflects nothing more than the fact\nthat much of the work was performed by attorneys whose \u201cfair and\nreasonable\u201d market rate was below the market average. There is\nnothing unfair about compensating these attorneys at the very rate that\nthey requested.\n\f14                    PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaningful appellate review. Needless to say, we do not\nquestion the sincerity of the District Court\u2019s observations,\nand we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But\nwhen a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impres\nsionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method\u2014\nproviding an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see\nid., at 566\u2014is undermined.\n    Determining a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d is a matter\nthat is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\nsee 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 (permitting court, \u201cin its discretion,\u201d\nto award fees), but the judge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited.\nIt is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific\nexplanation for all aspects of a fee determination, includ\ning any award of an enhancement. Unless such an expla\nnation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible,\nand without such review, widely disparate awards may be\nmade, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may\nappear to be influenced) by a judge\u2019s subjective opinion\nregarding particular attorneys or the importance of the\ncase. In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplat\ning the possibility of settlement will have no way to esti\nmate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge\nenhancement. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 7 (1985)\n(\u201c \u2018[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a bind\ning settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liabil\nity for attorney\u2019s fees in whatever amount the court might\nfix on motion of the plaintiff \u2019 \u201d).\n    Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by\nmaking it possible for persons without means to bring suit\nto vindicate their rights. But unjustified enhancements\nthat serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with\nthe statute\u2019s aim.8 In many cases, attorney\u2019s fees awarded\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion dramatically illustrates the danger of\n\nallowing a trial judge to award a huge enhancement not supported by\nany discernible methodology. That approach would retain the $4.5\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Instead, the fees are paid in effect by\nstate and local taxpayers, and because state and local\ngovernments have limited budgets, money that is used to\npay attorney\u2019s fees is money that cannot be used for pro\ngrams that provide vital public services.

S. C. \u00a71988 after \u201cachiev[ing] only\nlimited success\u201d litigating their clients\u2019 constitutional\nclaims. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 431 (1983).\nThis Court\u2019s opinion resolving their claim for fees observed\nthat \u201cin some cases of exceptional success an enhanced\naward\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988 \u201cmay be justified.\u201d\nId., at 435 (emphasis added). That observation plainly\nwas dicta, but one year later this Court relied on it to\nreject the \u201cargument that an \u2018upward adjustment\u2019 \u201d to the\nlodestar calculation \u201cis never permissible.\u201d Blum v.

Yet \u201cwe have never sus\ntained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for perform\nance,\u201d ante, at 8, and our jurisprudence since Blum has\ncharted \u201ca decisional arc that bends decidedly against\nenhancements,\u201d 532 F. 3d 1209, 1221 (CA11 2008)\n(Carnes, J.).

The Court answers that question in the\naffirmative. See ante, at 1 (\u201cWe have stated in previous\ncases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary\ncircumstances, and we reaffirm that rule\u201d); see also ante,\np. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As our prior precedents\nmake clear, the lodestar calculation \u201cdoes not end the [fee]\ninquiry\u201d because there \u201cremain other considerations that\nmay lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.\u201d\nHensley v.

Instead, as\nthe Court today reaffirms, when \u201csuperior attorney per\nformance,\u201d ibid., leads to \u201cexceptional success an enhanced\naward may be justified,\u201d Hensley supra, at 435; see also\nPennsylvania v.

S. 886, 896\u2013900 (1984). I agree with that conclusion.\n  Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a\nquestion that is not presented, but that the Court\nobliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to\nconsider nonetheless\u2014namely, whether the lower courts\ncorrectly determined in this case that exceptional circum\nstances justify a lodestar enhancement. See Parts IV\u2013V,\nante; see also ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). I\nwould not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow\nquestion that we agreed to consider. See 556 U. S. __\n(2009) (limiting review to the first question presented);\nPet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also Glover v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (\u201cAs a general rule . . . we\ndo not decide issues outside the questions presented . . .\u201d).\nNor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed\nfrom the litigation underlying the fee determination, is\nproperly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71988 demands. But even were I to engage in\nthat inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement. And\nI would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n\n  As the Court explains, the basic question that must be\nresolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar\nis whether the lodestar calculation \u201cadequately meas\nure[s]\u201d an attorney\u2019s \u201cvalue,\u201d as \u201cdemonstrated\u201d by his\nperformance \u201cduring the litigation.\u201d Ante, at 10. While I\nunderstand the need for answering that question through\nthe application of standards, I also believe that the answer\ninevitably involves an element of judgment. Moreover,\nwhen reviewing a district court\u2019s answer to that question,\nan appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact\nthat a district court is better situated to provide that\nanswer. For it is the district judge, and only the district\njudge, who will have read all of the motions filed in the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

In a word, the district judge will have\nobserved the attorney\u2019s true \u201cvalue, as demonstrated . . .\nduring the litigation.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). By con\ntrast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps\nlengthy record, will inevitably have less time and oppor\ntunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an\nexceptionally fine job. And this Court is yet less suited to\nperforming that inquiry.         Accordingly, determining\nwhether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case\n\u201cis a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a\ntrial judge,\u201d ante, at 13, and the function of appellate\ncourts is to review that judge\u2019s determination for an abuse\nof such discretion. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S.\n552, 571 (1988); see also General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522\nU. S. 136, 143 (1997) (\u201c[D]eference . . . is the hallmark of\nabuse-of-discretion review\u201d).\n   This case well illustrates why our tiered and function\nally specialized judicial system places the task of deter\nmining an attorney\u2019s fee award primarily in the district\ncourt\u2019s hands. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers spent eight years\ninvestigating the underlying facts, developing the initial\ncomplaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out\nfinal relief. The District Court\u2019s docket, with over 600\nentries, consists of more than 18,000 pages. Transcripts of\nhearings and depositions, along with other documents,\nhave produced a record that fills 20 large boxes. Neither\nwe, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire\nrecord. Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district\njudge who is aware of the many intangible matters that\nthe written page cannot reflect.\n   My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly\nbe exhaustive. But those portions of the record I have\nreviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals,\n\f4                     PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when\nawarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based\non four considerations.\n   First, the record indicates that the lawyers\u2019 objective in\nthis case was unusually important and fully consistent\nwith the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights\nstatute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Moreover, the problem the\nattorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of\nskill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their\nclients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its\nentire foster-care system\u2014a system that much in the\nrecord describes as well below the level of minimal consti\ntutional acceptability. The record contains investigative\nreports, mostly prepared by Georgia\u2019s own Office of the\nChild Advocate, which show, for example, the following:\n    \u2022\t The State\u2019s foster-care system was unable to provide\n       essential medical and mental health services; children\n       consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and\n       life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear\n       ing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to ad\n       minister basic care and antibiotics. See, e.g., Doc. 3,\n       Exh. 3C, pp. 11\u201313.\n    \u2022\t Understaffing and improper staffing placed children\n       in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal re\n       cords; children were physically assaulted by the staff,\n       locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,\n       and abused in other ways.

The State, for example,\nargued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate\nthe shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might\nhave approved the investigations, the State then removed\nthe case to federal court; the State then sought protective\norders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the\nshelters\u2019 staff; and, after losing its motions, the State\ndelayed to the point where the District Court \u201cwas forced\nto admonish [the] State Defendants for \u2018relying on techni\ncal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay\nand hinder the discovery process.\u2019 \u201d 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,\n1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See\nalso Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9\u201310; Docs. 26, 28\u201329, 44, 60.\n  In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing\nthe motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger\nabstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the\nDistrict Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284\u2013\n290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37\n(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),\nand District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460\nU. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners\u2019\nrequest to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster\ncare, but the District Court again rejected the State\u2019s\nargument. 218 F. R. D., at 299\u2013302. And, after that, the\nState filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re\ncord, Docs. 243\u2013245, which plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys opposed in\nthorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,\nsee Docs. 254\u2013258, 260. After losing that motion and\neventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro\ntracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See\nDocs. 363\u2013364, 366, 369\u2013370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in\nopposing the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to have the foster-care\nsystem reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside\ncounsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,\nworked significantly more hours than that figure alone\n\f8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nindicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi\ntional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.\n   Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained\nby the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys appear to have been excep\ntional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the\ncourse of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the\nState will take in order to address the specific deficiencies\nof the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see\nalso App. 92\u2013207 (consent decree). And it establishes a\nreporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by\nthe District Court\u2019s enforcement authority. See 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State\nagreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,\nto the benefit of children in many different communities.\nAnd informed observers have described the decree as\nhaving brought about significant positive results. See,\ne.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed\noverseers\u2019 report) (\u201cThe State\u2019s overall performance . . .\ncontinues the trend of steady improvement . . .\u201d); id., at 4\u2013\n10 (detailing substantial health, safety, and welfare im\nprovements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.\nReport (2008), Letter from Tom C.

Supp. 2d, at 1282;\n 2. \u201cbased on its personal observation of plaintiffs\u2019 coun\n    sel\u2019s performance throughout this litigation, the Court\n    finds that . . . counsel brought a higher degree of skill,\n    commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this\n    litigation than the Court has seen displayed by the at\n    torneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\n    bench,\u201d id., at 1288\u20131290;\n 3. the Consent Decree \u201cprovided extraordinary benefits\n    to the plaintiff class . . . .\u201d Id., at 1282. \u201c[T]he settle\n    ment achieved by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel is comprehensive\n    in its scope and detailed in its coverage. . . . After 58\n    years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the\n    Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff\n    class has achieved such a favorable result on such a\n    comprehensive scale,\u201d id., at 1289\u20131290.\nBased on these observations and on its assessment of the\nattorneys\u2019 performance during the course of the litigation,\nthe District Court concluded that \u201cthe evidence establishes\nthat the quality of service rendered by class counsel . . .\nwas far superior to what consumers of legal services in the\nlegal marketplace . . . could reasonably expect to receive\nfor the rates used in the lodestar calculation.\u201d Id., at\n1288.\n  On the basis of what I have read, I believe that assess\nment was correct. I recognize that the ordinary lodestar\ncalculation yields a large fee award. But by my assess\n\f10                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an\naverage hourly fee per attorney of $249. See id., at 1287\n(lodestar calculation and attorney hours). (The majority\u2019s\nreference to an hourly fee of $866, ante, at 12, refers to the\nrate associated with the single highest paid of the 17\nattorneys under the enhanced fee, not the average hourly\nrate under the lodestar. The lay reader should also bear\nin mind that a lawyer\u2019s \u201cfee\u201d is substantially greater than\nhis \u201cprofit,\u201d given that attorneys must sometimes cover\ncase-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000,\nsee 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine\noverhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their\nfees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law\nFirm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).\n   At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this\ngroup of attorneys\u2014whom the District Court described as\nextraordinary\u2014at a rate lower than the average rate\ncharged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Geor\ngia, where the average hourly rate is $268. See id., at 89.\nAccordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge\nthat some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this\ncase. See ante, at 10 (\u201c[A]n enhancement may be appro\npriate where the method used in determining the hourly\nrate employed in the lodestar calculation does not ade\nquately measure the attorney\u2019s true market value, as\ndemonstrated in part during the litigation\u201d). Indeed, the\nfact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case\nwhere \u201cmuch of the work,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 7, was performed\nby relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly,\nwould be compensated by the lodestar \u201cbelow the market\naverage,\u201d ibid.) is all the more reason to think that their\nservice rendered their outstanding performance worthy of\nan enhancement. By comparison, the District Court\u2019s\nenhanced award\u2014a special one-time adjustment unique to\nthis exceptional case\u2014would compensate these attorneys,\non this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435,\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

See Firm\nby-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National\nLaw Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p.

Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award\nis wholly consistent with the purpose of \u00a71988, which was\nenacted to ensure that \u201ccounsel for prevailing parties [are]\npaid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee\npaying client.\u201d S.

S., at 893, 897.\n   In any event, the circumstances I have listed likely\nmake this a \u201crare\u201d or \u201cexceptional\u201d case warranting an\nenhanced fee award. And they certainly make clear that it\nwas neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion for\nthe District Court to reach that conclusion. Indeed, if the\nfacts and circumstances that I have described are even\nroughly correct, then it is fair to ask: If this is not an\nexceptional case, what is?\n                       *     *     *\n  My disagreement with the Court is limited.

Our prior cases make clear that enhancements\nare permitted in \u201c \u2018exceptional\u2019 cases,\u201d Delaware Valley,\n478 U.

By definition, such exceptional circum\nstances occur only rarely. See ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). I do not see how the Court could \u201cadvance\u201d\nour fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further dis\ncourage lodestar enhancements without overruling the\nprecedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.\nTo the contrary, today the Court \u201creaffirm[s]\u201d those prece\ndents, which allow enhancements for exceptional perform\nance. Ante, at 1. And with respect to that central holding\nwe are unanimous.\n   Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with\nrespect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for\nthe Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court\nfrom awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court\nprovides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.\nAnte, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. But the majority and I\ndo disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judg\nment below. \u201cA request for attorney\u2019s fees should not\nresult in a second major litigation.\u201d Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n437. Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate\nreview. See id., at 455\u2013456 (Brennan, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). We did not grant certiorari\nin this case to consider the fact-intensive dispute over\nwhether this is, in fact, an exceptional case that merits a\nlodestar enhancement. The District Court has already\nresolved that question and the Court of Appeals affirmed\nits judgment, having found no abuse of discretion. I would\nhave been content to resolve no more than the question\npresented.

Argued December 9, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nPetitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par\n  cel tankers\u2014seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately\n  chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish\n  to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur\n  suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char\n  ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi\n  tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit\n  against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated\n  with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in\n  which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling\n  that the charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con\n  sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their\n  antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a\n  class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par\n  ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree\n  ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who\n  would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American\n  Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz\n  zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter\n  mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The\n  parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as\n  the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was\n  \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the\n  arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court\n  vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators\u2019 award was\n  made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law, for had the arbitrators con\n  ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of\n\f2        STOLT-NIELSEN S.

The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be\n    cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of\n    custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision\n    was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra\n    tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es\n    tablished a rule against class arbitration.\nHeld: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au\n thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration\n Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq. Pp. 7\u201323.\n    (a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own\n policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de\n rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA \u00a710(a)(4)\n on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, \u201conly when\n [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the\n agreement and effectively \u2018dispense[s] his own brand of industrial\n justice,\u2019 \u201d Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.\n 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator\u2019s task is to interpret and en\n force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.\n       (2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on\n AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument for permitting class arbitration\n under the charter party\u2019s arbitration clause. However, because the\n parties agreed that their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d on the class arbitra\n tion issue, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was to identify the rule of law\n governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on\n post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were\n based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York\n law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a\n \u201cdefault rule\u201d permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra\n tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com\n mon-law court\u2019s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule\n for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception\n of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration\n was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its\n own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The\n panel\u2019s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any\n thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA\n \u00a710(b), this Court must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by the arbitrators\u201d\n or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there\n can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to\n direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7\u201312.\n    (b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in\n stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this\n\f                   Cite as: 559 U.

Pp. 12\u201317.\n      (1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which\nconcerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers\nthat had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class\narbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the\ncourt or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were \u201csilent\u201d\non the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on\nhis resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci\nsionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows\nclass arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri\nate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.\nPp. 12\u201315.\n      (2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at\ntheir arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to\nhave believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de\ncide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad\ndressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited\nhere because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra\ntion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis\nsible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have\nmisunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in\ndeciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left\nthat question open. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   (c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.\nPp. 17\u201323.\n      (1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including\nthe basic precept that arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent, not coer\ncion.\u201d Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\nU. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a \u201cwritten provision in any\nmaritime transaction\u201d calling for the arbitration of a controversy\narising out of such transaction \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and en\nforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, and permits a party to an\narbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order\ndirecting that arbitration proceed \u201cin the manner provided for in such\nagreement,\u201d \u00a74. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA\u2019s central\npurpose is to ensure that \u201cprivate agreements to arbitrate are en\nforced according to their terms.\u201d Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.

S. 279, 289.\n    Pp. 17\u201320.\n         (2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to\n    submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con\n    cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel\n    imposed class arbitration despite the parties\u2019 stipulation that they\n    had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d on that issue. The panel\u2019s conclusion is\n    fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi\n    tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that\n    parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra\n    tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties\u2019\n    agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,\n    84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is\n    not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an\n    agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and\n    complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.\n    Pp. 20\u201323.\n548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

In one of these,\nthe District Court for the District of Connecticut held that\nthe charterers\u2019 claims were not subject to arbitration\nunder the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen\nS. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was\npending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\nordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against\npetitioners, including AnimalFeeds\u2019 action, in the District\nof Connecticut.

ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n539 U. S. 444 (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with\nthe plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator,\nas a threshold matter, to determine \u201cwhether the applica\u00ad\nble arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed\non behalf of or against a class.\u201d App. 56a.\n   The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipu\u00ad\nlated that the arbitration clause was \u201csilent\u201d with respect\nto class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to\nthe arbitration panel that the term \u201csilent\u201d did not simply\nmean that the clause made no express reference to class\narbitration. Rather, he said, \u201c[a]ll the parties agree that\nwhen a contract is silent on an issue there\u2019s been no\nagreement that has been reached on that issue.\u201d Id.,\nat 77a.\n   After hearing argument and evidence, including testi\u00ad\nmony from petitioners\u2019 experts regarding arbitration\ncustoms and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators\nconcluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class\narbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other\narbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed \u201ca wide\nvariety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing\nfor class arbitration,\u201d but the panel acknowledged that\nnone of these decisions was \u201cexactly comparable\u201d to the\npresent dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a.\nPetitioners\u2019 expert evidence did not show an \u201cinten[t] to\npreclude class arbitration,\u201d the arbitrators reasoned, and\npetitioners\u2019 argument would leave \u201cno basis for a class\naction absent express agreement among all parties and\nthe putative class members.\u201d Id., at 51a.\n   The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the par\u00ad\nties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an appli\u00ad\ncation to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award in the District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York.

The District Court\nvacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators\u2019 deci\u00ad\nsion was made in \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of the law insofar\nas the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analy\u00ad\nsis. 435 F.

Had such an analysis been conducted,\nthe District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied\nthe rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts\nbe interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp.\n2d, at 385\u2013386.\n   AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which\nreversed. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a716(a)(1)(E) (\u201cAn appeal may be\ntaken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award\u201d). As an\ninitial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the \u201cmani\u00ad\nfest disregard\u201d standard survived our decision in Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576\n(2008), as a \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the enumerated grounds for\nvacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U. S. C. \u00a710. 548\nF. 3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a\nfederal maritime rule of custom and usage against class\narbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 decision was not in manifest\ndisregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97\u201398. Nor had\nthe arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the\nCourt of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York\n\f6        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

See post, at 1, 3\u20136 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,\nthe dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument\n\u201cwe necessarily considered and rejected\u201d in granting certiorari. United\nStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu\u00ad\ntional considerations that implicate \u201cArticle III limitations on judicial\npower,\u201d as well as \u201cprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18\n(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial\nreview, we consider both \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision\u201d\nand \u201cthe hardship of withholding court consideration.\u201d National Park\nHospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).\nTo the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we\ngranted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.\nThe arbitration panel\u2019s award means that petitioners must now submit\nto class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners\nare correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the\nparties\u2019 agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class\nRule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association\nas Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what\nthey maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would\nalmost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\n143 (1974) (\u201cWhere the inevitability of the operation of a statute\nagainst certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of\na justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the\ndisputed provisions will come into effect\u201d). We think it is clear on these\nfacts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that\ntheir question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the\ndissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that\nargument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,\nn. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express\nno view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a\nquestion of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park\nHospitality Assn., supra, at 808 (\u201c[E]ven in a case raising only pruden\u00ad\ntial concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court\u2019s\nown motion\u201d).\n\f                      Cite as: 559 U.

It is not enough for peti\u00ad\ntioners to show that the panel committed an error\u2014or\neven a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000); Paperworkers v.\nMisco, Inc., 484 U.

In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi\u00ad\ntration panel did was simply to impose its own view of\nsound policy regarding class arbitration.3\n                         B\n                         1\n  In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration pro\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We  do not decide whether \u201c \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 \u201d survives our deci\u00ad\nsion in Hall Street Associates, L.

Animal-\nFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the\narbitrators \u201cknew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this\nprinciple controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless\nwillfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar\nguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea\u00ad\nsons that follow.\n\f8     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in sup-\nport of construing the arbitration clause to permit class\narbitration:\n       \u201cThe parties\u2019 arbitration clause should be construed\n    to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is si-\n    lent on the issue of class treatment and, without ex-\n    press prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under\n    Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit\n    class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)\n    the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable\n    if it forbade class arbitration.\u201d App. in No. 06\u20133474\u2013\n    cv (CA2), at A\u2013308 to A\u2013309 (emphasis added).\n   The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds\u2019 first\nargument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing\nabout the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested\nits decision on AnimalFeeds\u2019 public policy argument.\nBecause the parties agreed their agreement was \u201csilent\u201d in\nthe sense that they had not reached any agreement on the\nissue of class arbitration, the arbitrators\u2019 proper task was\nto identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.\nHad they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably\nwould have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the\ntwo bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,\ni.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the\npanel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule\nof decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt\nto determine what rule would govern under either mari-\ntime or New York law in the case of a \u201csilent\u201d contract.\nInstead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbi-\ntral decisions that \u201cconstrued a wide variety of clauses in a\nwide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a.

S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.4\n   Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law,\nor New York law contains a \u201cdefault rule\u201d under which an\narbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitra\u00ad\ntion in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded\nas if it had the authority of a common-law court to develop\nwhat it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a\nsituation. Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among\narbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in \u201ca wide\nvariety of settings,\u201d the panel considered only whether\nthere was any good reason not to follow that consensus in\nthis case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a\u201350a. The panel was\nnot persuaded by \u201ccourt cases denying consolidation of\narbitrations,\u201d5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party had \u201cnever been the basis of a class action,\u201d\nor by expert opinion that \u201csophisticated, multinational\ncommercial parties of the type that are sought to be in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The panel\u2019s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the\n\npanel\u2019s decision was not based on a determination regarding the\nparties\u2019 intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA\u2019s\nClass Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available\nwhen the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during\nthe class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2\n2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the\npanel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that \u201c[w]hen you talk about\nexpectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were\nthe subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So\ntherefore, if you are going to talk about the parties\u2019 intentions, pre\n[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are\ncommon.\u201d App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to\nacknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a\ncontract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 50a.\n  5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,\n\n74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods.

Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for depart\u00ad\ning from the post-Bazzle arbitral consensus, the panel held\nthat class arbitration was permitted in this case.

The conclusion is inescapable that the\npanel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.7\n                              2\n  It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references\nto intent, but none of these shows that the panel did any\u00ad\nthing other than impose its own policy preference. The\nopinion states that, under Bazzle, \u201carbitrators must look\nto the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention whether they intended to permit or to\npreclude class action,\u201d and the panel added that \u201c[t]his is\nalso consistent with New York law.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. But the panel had no occasion to \u201cascertain the\nparties\u2019 intention\u201d in the present case because the parties\nwere in complete agreement regarding their intent.

But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators\nneed not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the\nhearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized\nthat the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds\nrelied involved \u201cessentially consumer non-value cases.\u201d App. 82a. In\nresponse, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those\nawards by asserting that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the claimants against\npetitioners \u201chave negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to\nlitigate than you would get if you won.\u201d Id., at 82a\u201383a. The panel\ncredited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not\ndemonstrated the parties\u2019 intent to preclude class arbitration, and\nfurther observed that if petitioners\u2019 anticonsolidation precedents\ncontrolled, then \u201cthere would appear to be no basis for a class action\nabsent express agreement among all parties and the putative class\nmembers.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.\n\f12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the\nVegoilvoy charter party was \u201csilent on whether [it] per\u00ad\nmit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,\u201d but that the\ncharter party was \u201cnot ambiguous so as to call for parol\nevidence.\u201d Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in\u00ad\nquiry regarding the parties\u2019 intent, and any inquiry into\nthat settled question would have been outside the panel\u2019s\nassigned task.\n   The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan\u00ad\nguage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but\nsince the only task that was left for the panel, in light of\nthe parties\u2019 stipulation, was to identify the governing rule\napplicable in a case in which neither the language of the\ncontract nor any other evidence established that the par\u00ad\nties had reached any agreement on the question of class\narbitration, the particular wording of the charter party\nwas quite beside the point.\n   In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of\ndecision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New\nYork law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy\nchoice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under\n\u00a710(b) of the FAA, we must either \u201cdirect a rehearing by\nthe arbitrators\u201d or decide the question that was originally\nreferred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can\nbe only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see\nno need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle \u201ccontrolled\u201d\nthe \u201cresolution\u201d of the question whether the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party \u201cpermit[s] this arbitration to proceed on\nbehalf of a class,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a\u201349a, but that\nunderstanding was incorrect.\n  Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender\n(Green Tree) and its customers.

Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted\nclass arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the\ncustomers.\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the\nawards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.\n244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Sev-\nenth Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority\nto order classwide arbitration under \u00a74 of the FAA, see\nChamp v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and\nconflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior\nCourt of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P. 2d 1192\n(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the\nCalifornia approach, which it characterized as permitting\na trial court to \u201corder class-wide arbitration under adhe-\nsive but enforceable franchise contracts,\u201d 351 S. C., at 259,\n266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the\nSouth Carolina court observed, a trial judge must\n\u201c[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies\u201d of\nrequiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual\nbasis against \u201cresulting prejudice to the drafting party\u201d\nand should take into account factors such as \u201cefficiency\u201d\nand \u201cequity.\u201d Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,\nand n. 15.\n   Applying these standards to the case before it, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause\nin the Green Tree contracts was \u201csilent regarding class-\nwide arbitration.\u201d Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as\nfollows:\n    \u201c[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be or-\n    dered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it\n    would serve efficiency and equity, and would not re-\n    sult in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhe-\n    sive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in\n\f14    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting\n     party could effectively prevent class actions against\n     it without having to say it was doing so in the\n     agreement.\u201d Id., at 266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 360 (footnote\n     omitted).\n   When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale\ncommanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who\njoined the judgment\u2014that is, the plurality opinion and\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 opinion\u2014collectively addressed three\nseparate questions. The first was which decision maker\n(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts\nin question were \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of class arbitration.\nThe second was what standard the appropriate decision\nmaker should apply in determining whether a contract\nallows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA\nentirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit\nclass arbitration only under limited circumstances, such\nas when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this\nquestion left entirely to state law?) The final question was\nwhether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class\narbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.\n   The plurality opinion decided only the first question,\nconcluding that the arbitrator and not a court should\ndecide whether the contracts were indeed \u201csilent\u201d on the\nissue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, \u201c[i]n\ncertain limited circumstances,\u201d involving \u201cgateway mat\u00ad\nters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration\nagreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra\u00ad\ntion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,\u201d it is\nassumed \u201cthat the parties intended courts, not arbitra\u00ad\ntors,\u201d to make the decision. 539 U. S., at 452. But the\nplurality opined that the question whether a contract with\nan arbitration clause forbids class arbitration \u201cdoes not\nfall into this narrow exception.\u201d Ibid. The plurality there\u00ad\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at 455 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did\nnot take a definitive position on the first question, stating\nonly that \u201c[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties\u2019\nagreement should have been made in the first instance by\nthe arbitrator.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he\ndid not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of\nthe appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach\nthat question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci\u00ad\nsion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that \u201cthe\ndecision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct\nas a matter of law.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by\u00ad\npassed the first question noted above and rested instead\non his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,\nBazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three\nquestions.\n                              B\n   Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have\nbaffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitra\u00ad\ntion proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have\nbelieved that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra\u00ad\ntor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class\narbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before\narbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: \u201cWhat\n[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is\nleft up to the arbitrator, that\u2019s the rule in [Bazzle]\u201d). In\n\f16     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfact, however, only the plurality decided that question.\nBut we need not revisit that question here because the\nparties\u2019 supplemental agreement expressly assigned this\nissue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that\nthis assignment was impermissible.\n  Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbi-\ntration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in an-\nother respect, namely, that it established the standard to\nbe applied by a decision maker in determining whether a\ncontract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class\narbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion\nby stating that the parties \u201cdiffer regarding the rule of\ninterpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel\ncontinued:\n     \u201cClaimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language\n     that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\n     action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents\n     that the test is a more general one\u2014arbitrators must\n     look to the language of the parties\u2019 agreement to as-\n     certain the parties\u2019 intention whether they intended to\n     permit or to preclude class action.\u201d Ibid.\nAs we have explained, however, Bazzle did not establish\nthe rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration\nis permitted.8 The decision in Bazzle left that question\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 AnimalFeeds   invokes the parties\u2019 supplemental agreement as evi-\ndence that petitioners \u201cwaived\u201d any claim that the arbitrators could not\nconstrue the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration.

The\nquestion that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was\nwhether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed\nfor class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement\nconferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter\nparty itself.

It falls to courts and\narbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,\nand when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose\nsight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.\n                              B\n   From these principles, it follows that a party may not be\ncompelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitra\u00ad\ntion panel imposed class arbitration even though the\nparties concurred that they had reached \u201cno agreement\u201d\non that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view\nof the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not \u201ces\u00ad\ntablish that the parties to the charter agreements in\u00ad\ntended to preclude class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n51a. Even though the parties are sophisticated business\nentities, even though there is no tradition of class arbitra\u00ad\ntion under maritime law, and even though AnimalFeeds\ndoes not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to\nchoose the charter party that is used for a particular\nshipment, the panel regarded the agreement\u2019s silence on\nthe question of class arbitration as dispositive. The\npanel\u2019s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun\u00ad\ndational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of\nconsent.\n   In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that\nparties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly\nauthorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Thus,\nwe have said that \u201c \u2018 \u201cprocedural\u201d questions which grow out\nof the dispute and bear on its final disposition\u2019 are pre\u00ad\nsumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to\ndecide.\u201d Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.\n79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\nLivingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is\ngrounded in the background principle that \u201c[w]hen the\nparties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract\nhave not agreed with respect to a term which is essential\nto a determination of their rights and duties, a term which\nis reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the\ncourt.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7204 (1979).\n   An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra\u00ad\ntion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\nsolely from the fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\nThis is so because class-action arbitration changes the\nnature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be\npresumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi\u00ad\ntration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency\nand speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to\nresolve specialized disputes.        See Gilmer v. Inter\nstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31 (1991); Mitsu\nbishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 628; see also 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed\u00ad\nupon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a\nsingle dispute between the parties to a single agreement,\nbut instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or\nperhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (\u201c[W]e\nbelieve domestic class members could be in the hundreds\u201d\nand that \u201c[t]here could be class members that ship to and\nfrom the U.

E. 2d, at 352\u2013353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals\nthat was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than\n$14 million by a single arbitrator). Under the Class Rules,\n\u201cthe presumption of privacy and confidentiality\u201d that\napplies in many bilateral arbitrations \u201cshall not apply in\nclass arbitrations,\u201d see Addendum to Brief for American\nArbitration Association as Amicus Curiae 10a (Class Rule\n9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties\u2019 assumptions\nwhen they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator\u2019s award no\nlonger purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra\u00ad\ntion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par\u00ad\nties as well. Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.

We\nthink that the differences between bilateral and class\u00ad\naction arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,\nconsistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that\nthe parties\u2019 mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi\u00ad\ntration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in\nclass proceedings.10\n   The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by\ncharacterizing the question before the arbitrators as being\nmerely what \u201cprocedural mode\u201d was available to present\nAnimalFeeds\u2019 claims. Post, at 9. If the question were that\nsimple, there would be no need to consider the parties\u2019\nintent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam,\nsupra, at 84 (committing \u201cprocedural questions\u201d presump\u00ad\ntively to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to\nthe dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz\u00ad\ning the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques\u00ad\ntion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class\narbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there\nwas \u201cno agreement\u201d on this question, it follows that the\nparties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to\nclass arbitration.\n                             V\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed\u00ad\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 We have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support\na finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\nHere, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was \u201cno agreement\u201d on\nthe issue of class-action arbitration.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion\nthat the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal mari\ntime law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to\nRule 3 of the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Supple\nmentary Rules for Class Arbitrations.

See also id., at 80a (noting\nconsistent recognition by arbitration panels that \u201ca silent\nbroadly worded arbitration clause, just like the one at\nissue here, should be construed to permit class arbitra\ntion\u201d); id., at 88a (\u201c[B]road . . . language . . . silent as to\nclass proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class\nproceeding.\u201d).\n   Stolt-Nielsen, the panel acknowledged, had vigorously\nargued, with the support of expert testimony, that \u201cthe\nbulk of international shippers would never intend to have\ntheir disputes decided in a class arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 52a. That concern, the panel suggested, might be\nmet at a later stage; \u201cif a class is certified,\u201d the panel\nnoted, class membership could be confined to those who\naffirmatively \u201c \u2018opt in\u2019 \u201d to the proceeding.

See ante, at 20 (\u201c[A] party may not\nbe compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so.\u201d); ante, at 23. The breadth of the\narbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiv\ning or banning class proceedings,10 will not do. Ante, at\n20\u201323.\n    The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authoriza\ntion to \u201cthe basic precept that arbitration \u2018is a matter of\nconsent, not coercion.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 17 (quoting Volt Informa\ntion Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford\nJunior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)). Parties may\n\u201cspecify with whom they choose to arbitrate,\u201d the Court\nobserves, just as they may \u201climit the issues they choose to\narbitrate.\u201d Ante, at 19. But arbitrators, in delineating an\nappropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard\nsuch contractual constraints. In this case, for example,\nAnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only\n\u201cclaims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]\n. . . that provides for arbitration.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the\nproposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of\npersons \u201cwith whom\u201d Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,\nand only \u201cissues\u201d subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em\nphasis omitted).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,\n\nclass arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not\nfeasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev\nable. See, e.g., In re American Express Merchants\u2019 Litigation, 554 F. 3d\n300, 315\u2013316, 320 (CA2 2009); Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F. 3d 25,\n55, 59 (CA1 2006); Discover Bank v.

Were there no right to proceed on\nbehalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or\nwaiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.\n\f12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT\u2019L CORP.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re\nquirement to the parties\u2019 right to stipulate rules under\nwhich arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,\nhowever, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu\nlation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a\nspecies of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. Alberto-\nCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties\nhad chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of\n\u201cany dispute\u201d involving a contract for ocean carriage of\ngoods. There is little question that the designated court,\nstate or federal, would have authority to conduct claims\nlike AnimalFeeds\u2019 on a class basis. Why should the class\naction prospect vanish when the \u201cany dispute\u201d clause is\ncontained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut\nGeneral Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,\n210 F. 3d 771, 774\u2013776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract\u2019s\nauthorization to arbitrate \u201c[a]ny dispute\u201d to permit con\nsolidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi\ntrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro\nceedings, see ante, at 21\u201322, then the claimant should\nretain its right to proceed in that format in court.\n                               B\n   When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no\nmore than modest in size, class proceedings may be \u201cthe\nthing,\u201d i.e., without them, potential claimants will have\nlittle, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617\n(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int\u2019l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,\n661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe realistic alternative to a class action\nis not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,\nas only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.\u201d).

Class arbitration may be ordered if\n\u201cthere is a contractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies] agreed\u201d \u201cto submit to class arbitration\u201d. Ante, at\n20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (\u201cWe have no occasion to decide\nwhat contractual basis may support a finding that the\nparties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\u201d).\nSecond, by observing that \u201cthe parties [here] are sophisti\ncated business entities,\u201d and \u201cthat it is customary for the\nshipper to choose the charter party that is used for a\nparticular shipment,\u201d the Court apparently spares from its\naffirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe\nsion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.\nWhile these qualifications limit the scope of the Court\u2019s\ndecision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators\u2019 judg\nment should not have been disturbed.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition\nfor want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.

Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac\n tion under \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging\n that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart\n attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com\n plaint is timely if filed no more than \u201c2 years after the discovery of\n the facts constituting the violation\u201d or 5 years after the violation. 28\n U. S. C. \u00a71658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un\n timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil\n ity of Merck\u2019s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than\n 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under\n take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the\n relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 \u201cVIGOR\u201d study com\n paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car\n diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to\n the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm\n caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let\n ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck\u2019s\n Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was \u201cfalse,\n lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading\u201d; and (3) pleadings\n filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al\n leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten\n tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding\n that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted\n with scienter, an element of a \u00a710(b) violation, and consequently did\n not commence the running of the limitations period.\nHeld:\n    1. The limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1) begins to run once the\n plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n\f2                      MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever\n    comes first. In the statute of limitations context, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often\n    used as a term of art in connection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doc\n    trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has\n    \u201cdiscovered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by\n    state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures\n    have sometimes codified this rule. When \u201cdiscovery\u201d is written di\n    rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re\n    fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery\n    of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in\n    tended courts to interpret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) simi\n    larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov\n    erning limitations period for private \u00a710(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,\n    Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding\n    that such actions \u201cmust be commenced within one year after the dis\n    covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,\u201d id., at 364 (empha\n    sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have\n    held that \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers\n    the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n    have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf\u2019s critical\n    language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,\n    when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece\n    dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013\n    117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use\n    of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the limitations context generally as well as in this\n    provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly\n    strong here. Merck\u2019s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8\u201312.\n       2. In determining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs, terms such\n    as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warnings\u201d may be useful insofar as\n    they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona\n    bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe\n    riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a\n    reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered \u201cthe facts consti\n    tuting the violation,\u201d including scienter\u2014irrespective of whether the\n    actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n    Pp. 12\u201317.\n          (a) Contrary to Merck\u2019s argument, facts showing scienter are\n    among those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d Scienter is assuredly a\n    \u201cfact.\u201d In a \u00a710(b) action, it refers to \u201ca mental state embracing in\n    tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n    425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important and neces\n    sary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues\n    & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319.

C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2), unless a \u00a710(b) complaint sets out facts\nshowing that it is more likely than not that the defendant acted with\nthe relevant intent, the claim will fail. It would frustrate the very\npurpose of the discovery rule codified in \u00a71658(b)(1) if the limitations\nperiod began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had \u201cdis\ncover[ed]\u201d any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12\u201314.\n     (b) The Court also rejects Merck\u2019s argument that, even if \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate\nrially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi\nnarily sufficient to show scienter. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue, the\nrelation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.\nFor instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm\u2019s future earnings,\nby itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber\nately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, \u201cdiscovery\u201d of additional\nscienter-related facts may be required. The statute\u2019s inclusion of an\nunqualified bar on actions instituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d\n\u00a71658(b)(2), should diminish Merck\u2019s fear that this requirement will\ngive life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts\ntaken long ago. P. 14.\n     (c) And the Court cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument that the limi\ntations period begins at \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d meaning the point where\nthe facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur\nther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the\nplaintiff would already have \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d facts showing scienter or\nother \u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d The statute says that the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim accrues only after the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those latter\nfacts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some\ntimes begin before \u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck also argues that\ndetermining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for judges\nto undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have\nlong had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this\nkind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14\u201317.\n  3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Septem\nber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here\nrelevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy\npothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy\npothesis as a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting\nMerck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al\nternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com\nplaints\u2019 general statements about Merck\u2019s state of mind show little\n\f4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    more. Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-\n    November 2001 circumstances reveal \u201cfacts\u201d indicating the relevant\n    scienter.

The complaint was\ntimely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs\n\u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute\nfor the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)\nwhen the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea\nsonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, \u201cthe facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. We\nalso hold that the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d include\nthe fact of scienter, \u201ca mental state embracing intent to\ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this\nstandard, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination\nthat the complaint filed here was timely.\n                             I\n  The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves\ntors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co.\nand others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know\ningly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany\n\f2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning the use of Merck\u2019s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to\neconomic losses when the risks later became apparent).\nThe plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under\n\u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b); SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341\u2013342 (2005).\n   The applicable statute of limitations provides that a\n\u201cprivate right of action\u201d that, like the present action,\n\u201cinvolves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con\ntrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement\nconcerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of\u2014\n   \u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting\nthe violation; or\n   \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b).\n   The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,\n2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years\nof the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for\ntimeliness purposes is November 6, 2001\u2014two years\nbefore this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before\nthis date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the\n\u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d If so, by the time the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period\nin \u00a71658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had\nnot, and could not have, discovered by the critical date\nthose \u201cfacts,\u201d particularly not the facts related to scienter,\nand that their complaint was therefore timely.\n                            A\n  We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,\nas we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and\nthe opinions below.\n  1. 1990\u2019s. In the mid-1990\u2019s Merck developed Vioxx. In\n1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it\nfor prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe body\u2019s production of an enzyme called COX\u20132 (cyclooxy-\ngenase-2). COX\u20132 is associated with pain and inflamma-\ntion. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its\nclass like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not\ninhibit production of a second enzyme called COX\u20131\n(cyclooxygenase-1). COX\u20131 plays a part in the functioning\nof the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation\n(associated with blood clots). App. 50\u201351.\n   2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,\ncalled the \u201cVIGOR\u201d study. Id., at 291\u2013294. The study\ncompared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The\nstudy showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer\ngastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But\nthe study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every\n1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,\ncompared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took\nnaproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Com-\nparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib\nand Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343\nNew England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526\u20131527 (2000).\n   Merck\u2019s press release acknowledged VIGOR\u2019s adverse\ncardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were\n\u201cconsistent with naproxen\u2019s ability to block platelet aggre-\ngation.\u201d App. 291. Merck noted that, since \u201cVioxx, like all\nCOX\u20132 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggre-\ngation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.\u201d\nIbid. And Merck added that \u201csafety data from all other\ncompleted and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indica-\ntion of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic\nevents between Vioxx\u201d and either a placebo or comparable\ndrugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).\n   This theory\u2014that VIGOR\u2019s troubling cardiovascular\nfindings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred\nby naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx\u2014\nlater became known as the \u201cnaproxen hypothesis.\u201d In\nadvancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the\n\f4                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnaproxen benefit \u201chad not been observed previously.\u201d Id.,\nat 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all\nof the above\u2014the positive gastrointestinal results, the\ntroubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,\nand the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.\nSee id., at 355\u2013391, 508\u2013557.\n   3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about\nthe naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the\nFDA\u2019s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider\nMerck\u2019s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect\nVIGOR\u2019s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR\ncardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392\u2013\n395, 558\u2013577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a\nproducts-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that\n\u201cMerck\u2019s own research\u201d had demonstrated that \u201cusers of\nVioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as\ncompared to other less expensive, medications.\u201d Id., at\n869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation wrote that the available data raised a \u201ccau\ntionary flag\u201d and strongly urged that \u201ca trial specifically\nassessing cardiovascular risk\u201d be done. Id., at 331\u2013332;\nMukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular\nEvents Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286\nJAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg\nNews quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck\nhad \u201cadditional data\u201d that were \u201cvery, very reassuring,\u201d\nand Merck issued a press release stating that it stood\n\u201cbehind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of\nVioxx.\u201d App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a\nwarning letter released to the public on September 21,\n2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,\nMerck\u2019s Vioxx marketing was \u201cfalse, lacking in fair bal\nance, or otherwise misleading.\u201d Id., at 339. At the same\ntime, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d of the VIGOR results. Id., at\n340. But it found that Merck\u2019s \u201cpromotional campaign\nselectively present[ed]\u201d that hypothesis without adequately\nacknowledging \u201canother reasonable explanation,\u201d namely,\n\u201cthat Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio\nvascular] properties.\u201d Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to\nsend healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.\n    After the FDA letter was released, more products\nliability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885\u2013956. Merck\u2019s\nshare price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.\nBy October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October\n9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam\nined its own data and \u201cfound no evidence that Vioxx in\ncreased the risk of heart attacks.\u201d App. 504. It quoted the\npresident of Merck Research Laboratories as positing\n\u201c \u2018two possible interpretations\u2019 \u201d: \u201c \u2018Naproxen lowers the\nheart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Stock ana\nlysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that\nthe FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis\nremained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,\nat 614, 626, 628.\n                             B\n   We next set forth three important events that occurred\nafter the critical date.\n   1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the\nresults of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos\nton\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. After examining\nthe medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa\ntients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to\n90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart\nattack than those given either a different painkiller or no\npainkiller at all. Id., at 164\u2013165. (That is to say, if pa\ntients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at\nall suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of\npatients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)\n\f6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMerck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study\u2019s limita\ntions. Id., at 165\u2013167.\n   2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the\nmarket. It said that a new study had found \u201can increased\nrisk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18\nmonths of continuous therapy.\u201d Id., at 182 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly\ndescribed the results as \u201ctotally unexpected.\u201d Id., at 186.\nMerck\u2019s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.\n   3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published\nan article stating that \u201cinternal Merck e-mails and mar\nketing materials as well as interviews with outside scien\ntists show that the company fought forcefully for years to\nkeep safety concerns from destroying the drug\u2019s commer\ncial prospects.\u201d Id., at 189\u2013190. The article said that an\nearly e-mail from Merck\u2019s head of research had said that\nthe VIGOR \u201cresults showed that the cardiovascular events\n\u2018are clearly there,\u2019 \u201d that it was \u201c \u2018a shame but . . . a low\nincidence,\u2019 \u201d and that it \u201c \u2018is mechanism based as we wor\nried it was.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had\ngiven its salespeople instructions to \u201c \u2018DODGE\u2019 \u201d questions\nabout Vioxx\u2019s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,\n2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged\nthat Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the\nnaproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.\nIt said, for example, that Merck \u201cknew, at least as early as\n1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,\u201d and that a\n\u201c1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .\nserious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more\nfrequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a\ndifferent arthritis drug or placebo.\u201d Id., at 56, 58\u201359\n(emphasis and capitalization deleted).\n   Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d at least two\nyears earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it\nwas filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.\nThe court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the\n(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck\u2019s (Octo\nber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a\n\u201cpossibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented\nmaterial facts\u201d no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing\nthe plaintiffs on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d to look further. In re\nMerck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litigation,\n483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to \u201cshow that they\nexercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were\nunable to discover their injuries,\u201d the court took October 9,\n2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run\nand therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A\nmajority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while\nconstituting \u201cstorm warnings,\u201d did not suggest much by\nway of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d requiring them to investigate further.\nIn re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litiga\ntion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid\nered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the\n2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).\n   Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis\nagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo\nharous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita\ntions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of the need for investigation), with\nShah v. Meeker, 435 F. 3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but\nif plaintiff does investigate, period runs \u201cfrom the date\nsuch inquiry should have revealed the fraud\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care\nEmployees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d\n495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period always begins to\n\f8                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrun only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being\nput on \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d should have discovered facts con\nstituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe granted Merck\u2019s petition.\n                             II\n  Before turning to Merck\u2019s arguments, we consider a\nmore basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General\nagree that \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s word \u201cdiscovery\u201d refers not only to\na plaintiff\u2019s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to\nthe facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered. We agree. But because the statute\u2019s language\ndoes not make this interpretation obvious, and because we\ncannot answer the question presented without considering\nwhether the parties are right about this matter, we set\nforth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.\n\n   We recognize that one might read the statutory words\n\u201cafter the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\u201d\nas referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the\nrelevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,\nthe word \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often used as a term of art in con\nnection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doctrine that delays\naccrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has \u201cdiscov\nered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to\nthe general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues\nonce a plaintiff has a \u201ccomplete and present cause of ac\ntion,\u201d Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust\nFund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)\n(citing Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875); inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). This Court long ago recog\nnized that something different was needed in the case of\nfraud, where a defendant\u2019s deceptive conduct may prevent\na plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been\ndefrauded. Otherwise, \u201cthe law which was designed to\nprevent fraud\u201d could become \u201cthe means by which it is\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmade successful and secure.\u201d Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall.\n342, 349 (1875). Accordingly, \u201cwhere a plaintiff has been\ninjured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without\nany fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar\nof the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered.\u201d Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And for more than a century, courts have under\nstood that \u201c[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been\ndiscovered.\u201d 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \u00a7276b(11),\np. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401\u20131403, and nn. 74\u2013\n84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,\nsupra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\nR. Co., 120 U.

And\nwhen they have done so, state and federal courts have\ntypically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual\ndiscovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would know.

Before Congress enacted that statute, this\nCourt, having found in the federal securities laws the\nexistence of an implied private \u00a710(b) action, determined\nits governing limitations period by looking to other limita\ntions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,\nLipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350\n(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations\n\u201cdiffer[ing] slightly in terminology,\u201d the Court chose the\nlanguage in 15 U. S. C. \u00a778i(e), the statutory provision\nthat governs securities price manipulation claims. 501\nU. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that\nprivate \u00a710(b) actions \u201cmust be commenced within one\nyear after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola\ntion and within three years after such violation.\u201d Id., at\n364 (emphasis added).

C. \u00a777m, on which the\nconcurrence relies. See post, at 2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,\nand n. 7 (quoting \u00a777m).)\n  Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the\nmatter held that \u201cdiscovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov\ners the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,\nLaw v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785\u2013786 (CA7\n1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,\n353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,\n306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).\nSome of those courts noted that other limitations provi\nsions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that\nthe period begins to run \u201c \u2018after the discovery of the untrue\nstatement . . . or after such discovery should have been\nmade by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,\u2019 \u201d whereas\nthe formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting\n\u00a777m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at\n364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long\nbeen understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili\ngent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit\nprovision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at\n721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499\u2013\n500.\n  In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations\nstatute, it repeated Lampf\u2019s critical language. The statute\nsays that an action based on fraud \u201cmay be brought not\nlater than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of\nthe facts constituting the violation\u201d (or \u201c5 years after such\nviolation\u201d). \u00a7804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b) (emphasis added). (This\nstatutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc\n\f12               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,\n\u00a777m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an\naction be brought \u201cthree years after the earliest date on\nwhich the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or\nviolation\u201d (emphasis added)).)      Not surprisingly, the\nCourts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter\npret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in this statute as including not\nonly facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts\nany reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,\nStaehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d\n406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne\nParish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).\n   We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013117,\nand n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus\ntries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history\nand precedent surrounding the use of the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nin the limitations context generally as well as in this\nprovision in particular, the reasons for making this as\nsumption are particularly strong here. We consequently\nhold that \u201cdiscovery\u201d as used in this statute encompasses\nnot only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also\nthose facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown. And we evaluate Merck\u2019s claims accordingly.\n                             III\n   We turn now to Merck\u2019s arguments in favor of holding\nthat petitioners\u2019 claims accrued before November 6, 2001.\nFirst, Merck argues that the statute does not require\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related \u201cfacts.\u201d See Brief for Peti\ntioners 19\u201328. We cannot agree, however, that facts about\nscienter are unnecessary.\n   The statute says that the limitations period does not\nbegin to run until \u201cdiscovery of the facts constituting the\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation.\u201d    28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nScienter is assuredly a \u201cfact.\u201d In a \u00a710(b) action, scienter\nrefers to \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive,\nmanipulate, or defraud.\u201d Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,\nn. 12. And the \u201c \u2018state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as\nthe state of his digestion.\u2019 \u201d Postal Service Bd. of Gover\nnors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging\nton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).\n  And this \u201cfact\u201d of scienter \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important\nand necessary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d A plaintiff\ncannot recover without proving that a defendant made a\nmaterial misstatement with an intent to deceive\u2014not\nmerely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);\nErnst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted\nspecial heightened pleading requirements for the scienter\nelement of \u00a710(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2)\n(requiring plaintiffs to \u201cstate with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind\u201d (emphasis added)). As a\nresult, unless a \u00a710(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the\ncomplaint showing that it is more likely than not that the\ndefendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the\nclaim will fail. See Tellabs, supra, at 328. It would there\nfore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule in this\nprovision\u2014which, after all, specifically applies only in\ncases \u201cinvolv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or\ncontrivance,\u201d \u00a71658(b)\u2014if the limitations period began to\nrun regardless of whether a plaintiff had discovered any\nfacts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant con\ncealed for two years that he made a misstatement with an\nintent to deceive, the limitations period would expire\nbefore the plaintiff had actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the fraud.\n  We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are\namong those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d In so hold\ning, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support\n\f14               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na private \u00a710(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a\nplaintiff\u2019s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among\nthose that constitute \u201cthe violation\u201d and therefore need not\nbe \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d for a claim to accrue).\n   Second, Merck argues that, even if \u201cdiscovery\u201d requires\nfacts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi\nally false or misleading statement (or material omission)\nare ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See\nBrief for Petitioners 22, 28\u201329. But we do not see how\nthat is so. We recognize that certain statements are such\nthat, to show them false is normally to show scienter as\nwell. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would\nfalsely say \u201cI am not married\u201d without being aware of the\nfact that his statement is false. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue,\nhowever, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is\nmore context specific. An incorrect prediction about a\nfirm\u2019s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell\nus whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an\ninnocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the\nstatute may require \u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related facts\nbeyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be\nmaterially false or misleading. Merck fears that this\nrequirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen\ndants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress\u2019\ninclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions\ninstituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d \u00a71658(b)(2), giv\ning defendants total repose after five years, should dimin\nish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa\nrable bar not subject to equitable tolling).\n   Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to\nrun prior to November 2001 because by that point the\nplaintiffs were on \u201cinquiry notice.\u201d Merck uses the term\n\u201cinquiry notice\u201d to refer to the point \u201cat which a plaintiff\npossesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive\nof wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.\u201d\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of\nAppeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,\ne.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254\n(CA11 2002) (\u201c[I]nquiry notice [is] \u201c \u2018the term used for\nknowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\nbegin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had\nbeen infringed\u2019 \u201d). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (\u201cduty of\ninquiry\u201d arises once \u201ccircumstances would suggest to an\ninvestor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she\nhad been defrauded\u201d); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.\nKapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335\u20131336 (CA7 1997) (\u201cThe facts\nconstituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to\nincite the victim to investigate\u201d and \u201cto enable him to tie\nup any loose ends and complete the investigation in time\nto file a timely suit\u201d); Great Rivers Cooperative of South\neastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,\n896 (CA8 1997) (\u201cInquiry notice exists when the victim is\naware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\ninvestigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of\nthe defendant\u2019s misrepresentations\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   If the term \u201cinquiry notice\u201d refers to the point where the\nfacts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi\ngate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which\nthe plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing\nscienter or other \u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d But the\nstatute says that the plaintiff\u2019s claim accrues only after the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug\ngests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck points out that, as we\nhave discussed, see supra, at 8\u20139, the court-created \u201cdiscov\nery rule\u201d exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not\ngenerally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their\nclaims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here\nwith a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.\nBecause the statute contains no indication that the limita\ntions period should occur at some earlier moment before\n\f16                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cdiscovery,\u201d when a plaintiff would have begun investigat\ning, we cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument.\n   As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations\nperiod does generally begin at \u201cdiscovery,\u201d it should none\ntheless run from the point of \u201cinquiry notice\u201d in one par\nticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to\nundertake an investigation once placed on \u201cinquiry no\ntice.\u201d In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual\nplaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not \u201ceffectively\nexcuse a plaintiff\u2019s failure to conduct a further investiga\ntion\u201d by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff \u201cin the same position.\u201d Brief for Petition\ners 48.\n   We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same\nreason we reject \u201cinquiry notice\u201d as the standard gener\nally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply\nprovides that \u201cdiscovery\u201d is the event that triggers the 2\nyear limitations period\u2014for all plaintiffs. Cf. United\nStates v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (\u201cLaches within\nthe term of the statute of limitations is no defense at\nlaw\u201d). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain\ntiffs \u201cin the same position\u201d no matter whether they inves\ntigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations\nperiod puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on \u201cin\nquiry notice\u201d at a disadvantage because it lapses two years\nafter a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered\nthe necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves\ntigate or delays investigating may well not have discov\nered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have\nfound sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a \u00a710(b)\ncomplaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead\ning standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1\n2002) (\u201c[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may\nconsume as little as a few days or as much as a few years\nto get to the bottom of the matter\u201d).\n   Merck further contends that its proposed \u201cinquiry no\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntice\u201d standard is superior, because determining when a\nhypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n\u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for\njudges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional\ndiscovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad\ncircumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already\nask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,\ne.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New\nEngland Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at\n1, 9\u201310; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201\n(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122\nF. 3d 363, 367\u2013368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this\nprecedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that\nthe \u201cdiscovery\u201d of facts that put a plaintiff on \u201cinquiry\nnotice\u201d does not automatically begin the running of the\nlimitations period.\n\n  We conclude that the limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1)\nbegins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona\nbly diligent plaintiff would have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. In\ndetermining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those \u201cfacts\u201d\noccurred, terms such as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warn\nings\u201d may be useful to the extent that they identify a time\nwhen the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent\nplaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period\ndoes not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov\ners or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov\nered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation,\u201d including sci\nenter\u2014irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff\nundertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n                            IV\n  Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal\narguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem\n\f18               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have\ndiscovered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d In re\nspect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA\u2019s\nSeptember 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck\nhad \u201c \u2018minimized\u2019 \u201d the VIGOR study\u2019s \u201c \u2018potentially serious\ncardiovascular findings\u2019 \u201d and (2) pleadings filed in prod\nucts-liability actions in September and October 2001\nalleging that Merck had \u201c \u2018omitted, suppressed, or con\ncealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks\nassociated with Vioxx\u2019 \u201d and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ\nated with Vioxx.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 36\u201337 (quoting\nApp. 340, 893).\n   The FDA\u2019s warning letter, however, shows little or\nnothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether\nMerck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent\nintent. See Part I\u2013A(4), supra. The FDA itself described\nthe pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a \u201cpossible explana\ntion\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing\nsufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to\nMerck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.\n   The products-liability complaints\u2019 statements about\nMerck\u2019s knowledge show little more. See Part I\u2013A(3),\nsupra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con\ntained any specific information suggesting the fraud al\nleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis\nwas false even as it promoted it. And, without providing\nany reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access\nto information about Merck\u2019s state of mind, the complaints\nalleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed\ninformation about Vioxx and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated\u201d the risks associated with Vioxx\u2014the\nsame charge made in the FDA warning letter. App. 893.\n   In our view, neither these two circumstances nor any of\nthe other pre-November 2001 circumstances that we have\nset forth in Part I\u2013A, supra, whether viewed separately or\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U.

Regardless of\nwhich, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,\nconstituted \u201cdiscovery,\u201d we need only conclude that prior\nto November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff\nwould have discovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the viola\ntion.\u201d In light of our interpretation of the statute, our\nholdings in respect to scienter, and our application of\nthose holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,\nand we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 suit\nis timely. We need not\u2014and do not\u2014pass upon the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham\nand Women\u2019s study might have triggered the statute of\nlimitations.

Ante, at\n12\u201319. In this case there is no difference between the time\nwhen the plaintiffs actually discovered the factual basis\nfor their claim and the time when reasonably diligent\nplaintiffs should have discovered those facts. For that\nreason, much of the discussion in Part II of the Court\u2019s\nopinion, see ante, at 8\u201312, is not necessary to support the\nCourt\u2019s judgment. Until a case arises in which the differ\nence between an actual discovery rule and a constructive\ndiscovery rule would affect the outcome, I would reserve\ndecision on the merits of JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s argument, post,\nat 1\u20137 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). With this reservation, I join the Court\u2019s excel\nlent opinion.\n\f                  Cite as: 559 U.

S. C. \u00a778j(b), must be brought within\n\u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d or \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation,\u201d whichever\ncomes first. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). I agree with the\nCourt that scienter is among the \u201cfacts constituting the\nviolation\u201d that a plaintiff must \u201cdiscove[r]\u201d for the limita\ntions period to begin. Ante, at 12\u201314 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I also agree that respondents\u2019 suit is\ntimely, but for a reason different from the Court\u2019s: Merck\nhas not shown that respondents actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d\nscienter more than two years before bringing suit.\n   In ordinary usage, \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs when one actually\nlearns something new. See Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)\n(defining \u201cdiscovery\u201d as \u201c[f]inding out or ascertaining\nsomething previously unknown or unrecognized\u201d). As the\nCourt notes, however, ante, at 8\u201310, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations \u201cdiscovery\u201d has long carried an\nadditional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer\ncising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\nfacts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,\n101 U. S. 135, 140\u2013142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of\n\f2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nActions \u00a7276b(11)\u2013(13), pp. 1401\u20131408 (4th ed. 1916);\nDawson, Undiscovered Fraud and Statutes of Limitation,\n31 Mich. L. Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola\ntion, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) might mean constructive\ndiscovery.\n   In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13\nof the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab\nlished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under \u00a7\u00a711\nand 12 of that Act:\n    \u201cNo action shall be maintained to enforce any liability\n    created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title\n    unless brought within one year after the discovery of\n    the untrue statement or the omission, or after such\n    discovery should have been made by the exercise of\n    reasonable diligence . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a777m.\n\u201c[D]iscovery\u201d in \u00a777m obviously cannot mean constructive\ndiscovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase\n\u201cor after such discovery should have been made by the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Ibid. With \u00a777m al\nready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in\nthe 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778i(e), 78r(c), that did not\ncontain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab\nlished a time bar that runs from \u201cdiscovery\u201d simpliciter.\nWhen Congress enacted \u00a71658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing\na limitations period for private actions for \u201cfraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws,\u201d specifi\ncally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery\ncaveat. To interpret \u00a71658(b)(1) as imposing a construc\ntive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con\ntrary to common sense, that the same word means two\nvery different things in the same statutory context of\nlimitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the\n1933 and 1934 Acts.\n\f                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   True, the sensible presumption that a word means the\nsame thing when it appears more than once in the same\nstatutory context\u2014or even in the very same statute\u2014is\nrebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 595\u2013596 (2004). Context may make\nclear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,\nand in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596\u2013\n597. But nothing in the context of \u00a777m or \u00a71658(b)(1)\nsuggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita\ntions periods for federal-law claims based on various false\nstatements or omissions involving securities. The former\napplies to false statements or omissions in registration\nstatements, \u00a777k, and offers to sell securities, \u00a777l(a)(2);\nthe broad language of the latter (\u201cclaim[s] of fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws\u201d) covers\nother \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv\nance[s]\u201d made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d of\na security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com\nmission regulations, \u00a778j(b), including SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009). There is good reason, more\nover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private\n\u00a710(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive\ndiscovery rule for claims governed by \u00a777m: The elements\nof \u00a710(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more\ndifficult to discover than the elements of claims under\n\u00a777k or \u00a777l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean\nv. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208\u2013209 (1976); In re Morgan\nStanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d\n347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan\ndard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by \u00a777m.\nDetermining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an\nuntrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus\nis much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should\nhave learned that the defendant deliberately misled him\n\f4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusing a deceptive device covered by \u00a710(b).1\n   Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that\nwarrants giving \u201cdiscovery\u201d two meanings, the Court\nrelies on the historical treatment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in limita\ntions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat\ning a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8\u201310, 12. But\nthat history proves only that \u201cdiscovery\u201d can carry that\ntechnical meaning, and that without \u00a777m it would be\nreasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.\nIt does not show what \u201cdiscovery\u201d means in \u00a71658(b)(1) in\nlight of \u00a777m\u2019s codification of a constructive-discovery\nrule. In my view, the meaning of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the\nbroader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its\nmeaning in the more specific context of the federal securi\nties laws.\n   The Court\u2019s other reason for rejecting the more natural\nreading of \u00a71658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the\nCourts of Appeals before the provision\u2019s enactment. Ante,\nat 11\u201312. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.\nGilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we\nexplicitly adopted the terms of \u00a778i(e)\u2014which like\n\u00a71658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of\nreasonable diligence\u2014as the limitations period for the\nprivate \u00a710(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court appears to believe that \u00a777m\u2019s distinction between actual\n\nand constructive discovery has no bearing on \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s meaning\nbecause the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at\n11\u201312. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word\n(\u201cdiscovery\u201d) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;\nand its use in \u00a777m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.\n  The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes\nare irrelevant, ante, at 11\u201312, but of course it does not believe that. Its\nentire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state\nlegislatures), ante, at 8\u201310. Yet while the Court considers that broader\ncontext, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific\ncontext of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\n\f                     Cite as: 559 U.

Ante, at 11\u201312.\n  Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate\nthe Circuits\u2019 views\u2014which requires the further unrealistic\nassumption that a majority of each House knew of and\nagreed with the Courts of Appeals\u2019 opinions\u2014that would\nbe entirely irrelevant. Congress\u2019s collective intent (if such\na thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in\nany event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent\napart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).\n  The only way in which the Circuits\u2019 pre-2002 decisions\nmight bear on \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s meaning is if all (or nearly all)\nof the Circuits had interpreted \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a778i(e) to\nmean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could\nsay that those decisions had established the public mean\ning of the term in this context\u2014whether Congress knew of\n(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v. Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U.

To the con\ntrary, the fact that in enacting \u00a71658(b)(1) Congress did not copy\n\u00a777m\u2019s constructive-discovery proviso\u2014but decreed instead that \u201cdis\ncovery\u201d alone starts the clock (as it had done in \u00a778i(e), which we\nborrowed in Lampf)\u2014is what makes equating \u00a777m and \u00a71658(b)(1) so\nimplausible.\n\f6                MERCK & CO. v.

See Brief for Faculty\nat Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23\u201329 (here\ninafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the\nCourt and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting\nthe language Lampf adopted from \u00a778i(e) as imposing\nsome form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.\nFong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.\nBrown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard\nv.

S. 978 (1992).\nOthers, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not\ninterpreting \u00a778i(e) at all, but looked directly to \u00a777m,\ndespite Lampf\u2019s explicit selection of \u00a778i(e)\u2019s terms.

Another\ncourt candidly acknowledged that \u00a778i(e)\u2019s text\u2014unlike\n\u00a777m\u2019s\u2014forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe\nless held that courts remain \u201cfree to apply to [\u00a778i(e)] the\njudge-made doctrine of inquiry notice\u201d as a \u201cmodest and\ntraditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,\u201d since \u201cCon\ngress could not have known when it enacted [\u00a778i(e)] that\nthis section would someday provide the statute of limita\ntions for a wide range of securities frauds.\u201d Tregenza v.\nGreat American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721\u2013\n722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).\n   The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the\nissue before \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s enactment.

And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt\non a constructive-discovery view in dicta\u2014of which the\nomniscient Congress of the Court\u2019s imagining should also\nhave been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,\n175 F. 3d 699, 703\u2013705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water\nhouse, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).\n   This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere\nnear establishing that the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a778i(e)\nmeant constructive rather than actual discovery despite\n\u00a777m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d differently in \u00a71658(b)(1) and \u00a777m, I would\nhold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita\ntions period for \u00a710(b) claims. Since Merck points to no\nevidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter\nmore than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with\nthe Court that the suit was not time barred.\n   Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33\u201334,\nthat in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any\ndifference between actual and constructive discovery\nbecause of the presumption of reliance applicable in such\ncases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).\nIt seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis\ncussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price\nsignals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public\ninformation, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa\ntion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde\npendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a\nconstructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield\nthe same result, actual discovery is what \u00a71658(b)(1)\nrequires to start the limitations period.\n\f"}
